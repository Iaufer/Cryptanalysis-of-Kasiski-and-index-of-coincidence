TO TIME SHE SMOOTHED THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS AND WHENEVER 
THE STORY PRODUCED AN EFFECT SHE GLANCED AT ANNA PAVLOVNA 
AT ONCE ADOPTED JUST THE EXPRESSION SHE SAW ON THE MAID OF 
HONORS FACE AND AGAIN RELAPSED INTO HER RADIANT SMILE
THE LITTLE PRINCESS HAD ALSO LEFT THE TEA TABLE AND FOLLOWED

NOW I AM ALL RIGHT SHE SAID AND ASKING THE VICOMTE TO 
BEGIN SHE TOOK UP HER WORK
PRINCE HIPPOLYTE HAVING BROUGHT THE WORKBAG JOINED 
THE CIRCLE AND MOVING A CHAIR CLOSE TO HERS SEATED HIMSELF 
BESIDE HER
LE CHARMANT HIPPOLYTE WAS SURPRISING BY HIS EXTRAOR 
DINARY RESEMBLANCE TO HIS BEAUTIFUL SISTER BUT YET MORE BY 
THE FACT THAT IN SPITE OF THIS RESEMBLANCE HE WAS EXCEED 
INGLY UGLY HIS FEATURES WERE LIKE HIS SISTERS BUT WHILE IN 
HER CASE EVERYTHING WAS LIT UP BY A JOYOUS SELFSATISFIED 
YOUTHFUL AND CONSTANT SMILE OF ANIMATION AND BY THE WON 
DERFUL CLASSIC BEAUTY OF HER FIGURE HIS FACE ON THE CONTRARY 
WAS DULLED BY IMBECILITY AND A CONSTANT EXPRESSION OF SUL 
LEN SELFCONFIDENCE WHILE HIS BODY WAS THIN AND WEAK HIS 
EYES NOSE AND MOUTH ALL SEEMED PUCKERED INTO A VACANT 
WEARIED GRIMACE AND HIS ARMS AND LEGS ALWAYS FELL INTO UN 
NATURAL POSITIONS
ITS NOT GOING TO BE A GHOST STORY SAID HE SITTING DOWN 
BESIDE THE PRINCESS AND HASTILY ADJUSTING HIS LORGNETTE AS IF 
WITHOUT THIS INSTRUMENT HE COULD NOT BEGIN TO SPEAK
WHY NO MY DEAR FELLOW SAID THE ASTONISHED NARRATOR 
SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
BECAUSE I HATE GHOST STORIES SAID PRINCE HIPPOLYTE IN A 
TONE WHICH SHOWED THAT HE ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF 
HIS WORDS AFTER HE HAD UTTERED THEM
HE SPOKE WITH SUCH SELFCONFIDENCE THAT HIS HEARERS 
COULD NOT BE SURE WHETHER WHAT HE SAID WAS VERY WITTY OR  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMVERY STUPID HE WAS DRESSED IN A DARKGREEN DRESS COAT KNEE 
BREECHES OF THE COLOR OF CUISSE DE NYMPHE EFFRAYEE AS HE 
CALLED IT SHOES AND SILK STOCKINGS
THE VICOMTE TOLD HIS TALE VERY NEATLY IT WAS AN ANECDOTE 
THEN CURRENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DUC DENGHIEN HAD GONE 
SECRETLY TO PARIS TO VISIT MADEMOISELLE GEORGE THAT AT HER 
HOUSE HE CAME UPON BONAPARTE WHO ALSO ENJOYED THE FA 
MOUS ACTRESS FAVORS AND THAT IN HIS PRESENCE NAPOLEON 
HAPPENED TO FALL INTO ONE OF THE FAINTING FITS TO WHICH HE WAS 
SUBJECT AND WAS THUS AT THE DUCS MERCY THE LATTER SPARED 
HIM AND THIS MAGNANIMITY BONAPARTE SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID 
BY DEATH
THE STORY WAS VERY PRETTY AND INTERESTING ESPECIALLY AT 
THE POINT WHERE THE RIVALS SUDDENLY RECOGNIZED ONE ANOTHER 
AND THE LADIES LOOKED AGITATED
CHARMING SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA WITH AN INQUIRING 
GLANCE AT THE LITTLE PRINCESS
CHARMING WHISPERED THE LITTLE PRINCESS STICKING THE 
NEEDLE INTO HER WORK AS IF TO TESTIFY THAT THE INTEREST AND FAS 
CINATION OF THE STORY PREVENTED HER FROM GOING ON WITH IT
THE VICOMTE APPRECIATED THIS SILENT PRAISE AND SMILING 
GRATEFULLY PREPARED TO CONTINUE BUT JUST THEN ANNA PAVLOV 
NA WHO HAD KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE ON THE YOUNG MAN WHO SO 
ALARMED HER NOTICED THAT HE WAS TALKING TOO LOUDLY AND VE 
HEMENTLY WITH THE ABBE SO SHE HURRIED TO THE RESCUE PIERRE 
HAD MANAGED TO START A CONVERSATION WITH THE ABBE ABOUT THE 
BALANCE OF POWER AND THE LATTER EVIDENTLY INTERESTED BY THE 
YOUNG MANS SIMPLEMINDED EAGERNESS WAS EXPLAINING HIS 
PET THEORY BOTH WERE TALKING AND LISTENING TOO EAGERLY AND WAR AND PEACE TOO NATURALLY WHICH WAS WHY ANNA PAVLOVNA DISAPPROVED
THE MEANS ARE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN EUROPE AND THE 
RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THE ABBE WAS SAYING IT IS ONLY NECES 
SARY FOR ONE POWERFUL NATION LIKE RUSSIABARBARIC AS SHE IS 
SAID TO BETO PLACE HERSELF DISINTERESTEDLY AT THE HEAD OF AN 
ALLIANCE HAVING FOR ITS OBJECT THE MAINTENANCE OF THE BALANCE 
OF POWER OF EUROPE AND IT WOULD SAVE THE WORLD

WEARY BORED EXPRESSION TO HIS QUIET MEASURED STEP OFFERED 
A MOST STRIKING CONTRAST TO HIS QUIET LITTLE WIFE IT WAS EVI 
DENT THAT HE NOT ONLY KNEW EVERYONE IN THE DRAWING ROOM

FOUND SO TEDIOUS NONE SEEMED TO BORE HIM SO MUCH AS THAT 
OF HIS PRETTY WIFE HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER WITH A GRIMACE 
THAT DISTORTED HIS HANDSOME FACE KISSED ANNA PAVLOVNAS 
HAND AND SCREWING UP HIS EYES SCANNED THE WHOLE COMPA 
NY
YOU ARE OFF TO THE WAR PRINCE SAID ANNA PAVLOVNA
GENERAL KUTUZOV SAID BOLKONSKI SPEAKING FRENCH AND 
STRESSING THE LAST SYLLABLE OF THE GENERALS NAME LIKE A FRENCH 
MAN HAS BEEN PLEASED TO TAKE ME AS AN AIDEDECAMP
AND LISE YOUR WIFE
SHE WILL GO TO THE COUNTRY
ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO DEPRIVE US OF YOUR CHARMING 
WIFE
ANDRE SAID HIS WIFE ADDRESSING HER HUSBAND IN THE 
SAME COQUETTISH MANNER IN WHICH SHE SPOKE TO OTHER MEN WAR AND PEACE THE VICOMTE HAS BEEN TELLING US SUCH A TALE ABOUT MADEMOI 
SELLE GEORGE AND BUONAPARTE
PRINCE ANDREW SCREWED UP HIS EYES AND TURNED AWAY 
PIERRE WHO FROM THE MOMENT PRINCE ANDREW ENTERED THE 
ROOM HAD WATCHED HIM WITH GLAD AFFECTIONATE EYES NOW 
CAME UP AND TOOK HIS ARM BEFORE HE LOOKED ROUND PRINCE 
ANDREW FROWNED AGAIN EXPRESSING HIS ANNOYANCE WITH 
WHOEVER WAS TOUCHING HIS ARM BUT WHEN HE SAW PIERRES

HE TO PIERRE
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE HERE REPLIED PIERRE I WILL COME TO

DISTURB THE VICOMTE WHO WAS CONTINUING HIS STORY
NO IMPOSSIBLE SAID PRINCE ANDREW LAUGHING AND 
PRESSING PIERRES HAND TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO ASK 
THE QUESTION HE WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING MORE BUT AT THAT 
MOMENT PRINCE VASILI AND HIS DAUGHTER GOT UP TO GO AND THE 
TWO YOUNG MEN ROSE TO LET THEM PASS
YOU MUST EXCUSE ME DEAR VICOMTE SAID PRINCE VASI 
LI TO THE FRENCHMAN HOLDING HIM DOWN BY THE SLEEVE IN A 
FRIENDLY WAY TO PREVENT HIS RISING THIS UNFORTUNATE FETE AT 
THE AMBASSADORS DEPRIVES ME OF A PLEASURE AND OBLIGES ME 
TO INTERRUPT YOU I AM VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOUR ENCHANTING 
PARTY SAID HE TURNING TO ANNA PAVLOVNA
HIS DAUGHTER PRINCESS HELENE PASSED BETWEEN THE CHAIRS 
LIGHTLY HOLDING UP THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS AND THE SMILE SHONE 
STILL MORE RADIANTLY ON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE PIERRE GAZED AT HER  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWITH RAPTUROUS ALMOST FRIGHTENED EYES AS SHE PASSED HIM

SEEN HIM IN SOCIETY NOTHING IS SO NECESSARY FOR A YOUNG 
MAN AS THE SOCIETY OF CLEVER WOMEN
ANNA PAVLOVNA SMILED AND PROMISED TO TAKE PIERRE IN 
HAND SHE KNEW HIS FATHER TO BE A CONNECTION OF PRINCE VASI 
LIS THE ELDERLY LADY WHO HAD BEEN SITTING WITH THE OLD AUNT 
ROSE HURRIEDLY AND OVERTOOK PRINCE VASILI IN THE ANTEROOM 
ALL THE AFFECTATION OF INTEREST SHE HAD ASSUMED HAD LEFT HER 
KINDLY AND TEARWORN FACE AND IT NOW EXPRESSED ONLY ANXI 
ETY AND FEAR
HOW ABOUT MY SON BORIS PRINCE SAID SHE HURRYING 
AFTER HIM INTO THE ANTEROOM I CANT REMAIN ANY LONGER IN 
PETERSBURG TELL ME WHAT NEWS I MAY TAKE BACK TO MY POOR 
BOY
ALTHOUGH PRINCE VASILI LISTENED RELUCTANTLY AND NOT VERY 
POLITELY TO THE ELDERLY LADY EVEN BETRAYING SOME IMPATIENCE 
SHE GAVE HIM AN INGRATIATING AND APPEALING SMILE AND TOOK 
HIS HAND THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO AWAY
WHAT WOULD IT COST YOU TO SAY A WORD TO THE EMPEROR 
AND THEN HE WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GUARDS AT ONCE 
SAID SHE
BELIEVE ME PRINCESS I AM READY TO DO ALL I CAN ANSWERED 
PRINCE VASILI BUT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ASK THE EMPEROR I 
SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO APPEAL TO RUMYANTSEV THROUGH PRINCE WAR AND PEACE GOLITSYN THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY
THE ELDERLY LADY WAS A PRINCESS DRUBETSKAYA BELONG 
ING TO ONE OF THE BEST FAMILIES IN RUSSIA BUT SHE WAS POOR 
AND HAVING LONG BEEN OUT OF SOCIETY HAD LOST HER FORMER IN 
FLUENTIAL CONNECTIONS SHE HAD NOW COME TO PETERSBURG TO

SAID TRYING TO SMILE THOUGH TEARS WERE IN HER EYES
PAPA WE SHALL BE LATE SAID PRINCESS HELENE TURNING 
HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD AND LOOKING OVER HER CLASSICALLY MOLDED 
SHOULDER AS SHE STOOD WAITING BY THE DOOR
INFLUENCE IN SOCIETY HOWEVER IS A CAPITAL WHICH HAS TO 
BE ECONOMIZED IF IT IS TO LAST PRINCE VASILI KNEW THIS AND 
HAVING ONCE REALIZED THAT IF HE ASKED ON BEHALF OF ALL WHO 
BEGGED OF HIM HE WOULD SOON BE UNABLE TO ASK FOR HIM 
SELF HE BECAME CHARY OF USING HIS INFLUENCE BUT IN PRINCESS 
DRUBETSKAYAS CASE HE FELT AFTER HER SECOND APPEAL SOME  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMTHING LIKE QUALMS OF CONSCIENCE SHE HAD REMINDED HIM OF 
WHAT WAS QUITE TRUE HE HAD BEEN INDEBTED TO HER FATHER FOR

SWHO HAVING ONCE MADE UP THEIR MINDS WILL NOT REST UNTIL 
THEY HAVE GAINED THEIR END AND ARE PREPARED IF NECESSARY TO

SPIRED TO GIVE HIM ALL THEIR SONS AS ADJUTANTS

PAPA SAID HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER IN THE SAME TONE AS BE 
FORE WE SHALL BE LATEWAR AND PEACE WELL AU REVOIR GOODBY YOU HEAR HER
THEN TOMORROW YOU WILL SPEAK TO THE EMPEROR
CERTAINLY BUT ABOUT KUTUZOV I DONT PROMISE

LOVNA AS HE WENT WITH THE SMILE OF A COQUETTISH GIRL WHICH 
AT ONE TIME PROBABLY CAME NATURALLY TO HER BUT WAS NOW 
VERY ILLSUITED TO HER CAREWORN FACE
APPARENTLY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER AGE AND BY FORCE OF HABIT 
EMPLOYED ALL THE OLD FEMININE ARTS BUT AS SOON AS THE PRINCE 
HAD GONE HER FACE RESUMED ITS FORMER COLD ARTIFICIAL EXPRES

TION AT MILAN ASKED ANNA PAVLOVNA AND OF THE COMEDY OF 
THE PEOPLE OF GENOA AND LUCCA LAYING THEIR PETITIONS BEFORE 
MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE AND MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE SITTING ON 
A THRONE AND GRANTING THE PETITIONS OF THE NATIONS ADOR 
ABLE IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONES HEAD WHIRL IT IS AS IF THE 
WHOLE WORLD HAD GONE CRAZY
PRINCE ANDREW LOOKED ANNA PAVLOVNA STRAIGHT IN THE

DIEU ME LA DONNE GARE A QUI LA TOUCHE THEY SAY HE 
WAS VERY FINE WHEN HE SAID THAT HE REMARKED REPEATING THE 
WORDS IN ITALIAN DIO MI LHA DATO GUAI A CHI LA TOCCHI

I HOPE THIS WILL PROVE THE LAST DROP THAT WILL MAKE THE 
GLASS RUN OVER ANNA PAVLOVNA CONTINUED THE SOVEREIGNS 
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENDURE THIS MAN WHO IS A MENACE TO EV 
ERYTHING
THE SOVEREIGNS I DO NOT SPEAK OF RUSSIA SAID THE VI 
COMTE POLITE BUT HOPELESS THE SOVEREIGNS MADAME WHAT 
HAVE THEY DONE FOR LOUIS XVII FOR THE QUEEN OR FOR MA

PRINCE HIPPOLYTE WHO HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE VICOMTE 
FOR SOME TIME THROUGH HIS LORGNETTE SUDDENLY TURNED COM 
PLETELY ROUND TOWARD THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND HAVING ASKED

HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS 
PIERRE WISHED TO MAKE A REMARK FOR THE CONVERSATION IN 
TERESTED HIM BUT ANNA PAVLOVNA WHO HAD HIM UNDER 
OBSERVATION INTERRUPTED
THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER SAID SHE WITH THE MELANCHOLY 
WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED ANY REFERENCE OF HERS TO THE IM 
PERIAL FAMILY HAS DECLARED THAT HE WILL LEAVE IT TO THE FRENCH 
PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN FORM OF GOVERNMENT

THAT IS DOUBTFUL SAID PRINCE ANDREW MONSIEUR LE VI 
COMTE QUITE RIGHTLY SUPPOSES THAT MATTERS HAVE ALREADY GONE 
TOO FAR I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO RETURN TO THE OLD RE 
GIME
FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD SAID PIERRE BLUSHING AND 
BREAKING INTO THE CONVERSATION ALMOST ALL THE ARISTOCRACY 
HAS ALREADY GONE OVER TO BONAPARTES SIDE
IT IS THE BUONAPARTISTS WHO SAY THAT REPLIED THE VICOMTE 
WITHOUT LOOKING AT PIERRE AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION
BONAPARTE HAS SAID SO REMARKED PRINCE ANDREW WITH A 
SARCASTIC SMILE
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE VICOMTE AND WAS 
AIMING HIS REMARKS AT HIM THOUGH WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM
I SHOWED THEM THE PATH TO GLORY BUT THEY DID NOT FOL 
LOW IT PRINCE ANDREW CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT SILENCE AGAIN 
QUOTING NAPOLEONS WORDS I OPENED MY ANTECHAMBERS AND 
THEY CROWDED IN I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN 
SAYING SO
NOT IN THE LEAST REPLIED THE VICOMTE AFTER THE MUR 
DER OF THE DUC EVEN THE MOST PARTIAL CEASED TO REGARD HIM 
AS A HERO IF TO SOME PEOPLE HE WENT ON TURNING TO ANNA 
PAVLOVNA HE EVER WAS A HERO AFTER THE MURDER OF THE DUC

BROKE INTO THE CONVERSATION AND THOUGH ANNA PAVLOVNA FELT WAR AND PEACE SURE HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE SHE WAS UNABLE 
TO STOP HIM
THE EXECUTION OF THE DUC DENGHIEN DECLARED MONSIEUR 
PIERRE WAS A POLITICAL NECESSITY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NA

HIMSELF THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT DEED
DIEU MON DIEU MUTTERED ANNA PAVLOVNA IN A TERRI 
FIED WHISPER
WHAT MONSIEUR PIERRE DO YOU CONSIDER THAT ASSAS

OH OH EXCLAIMED SEVERAL VOICES
CAPITAL SAID PRINCE HIPPOLYTE IN ENGLISH AND BEGAN 
SLAPPING HIS KNEE WITH THE PALM OF HIS HAND
THE VICOMTE MERELY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS PIERRE LOOKED 
SOLEMNLY AT HIS AUDIENCE OVER HIS SPECTACLES AND CONTINUED
I SAY SO HE CONTINUED DESPERATELY BECAUSE THE BOUR 
BONS FLED FROM THE REVOLUTION LEAVING THE PEOPLE TO ANARCHY 
AND NAPOLEON ALONE UNDERSTOOD THE REVOLUTION AND QUELLED 
IT AND SO FOR THE GENERAL GOOD HE COULD NOT STOP SHORT FOR 
THE SAKE OF ONE MANS LIFE
WONT YOU COME OVER TO THE OTHER TABLE SUGGESTED ANNA 
PAVLOVNA
BUT PIERRE CONTINUED HIS SPEECH WITHOUT HEEDING HER
NO CRIED HE BECOMING MORE AND MORE EAGER NAPOLEON 
IS GREAT BECAUSE HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THE REVOLUTION SUP 
PRESSED ITS ABUSES PRESERVED ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN ITEQUALITY 
OF CITIZENSHIP AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OF THE PRESSAND 
ONLY FOR THAT REASON DID HE OBTAIN POWER FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMYES IF HAVING OBTAINED POWER WITHOUT AVAILING HIMSELF 
OF IT TO COMMIT MURDER HE HAD RESTORED IT TO THE RIGHTFUL 
KING I SHOULD HAVE CALLED HIM A GREAT MAN REMARKED THE 
VICOMTE
HE COULD NOT DO THAT THE PEOPLE ONLY GAVE HIM POWER 
THAT HE MIGHT RID THEM OF THE BOURBONS AND BECAUSE THEY 
SAW THAT HE WAS A GREAT MAN THE REVOLUTION WAS A GRAND 
THING CONTINUED MONSIEUR PIERRE BETRAYING BY THIS DES 
PERATE AND PROVOCATIVE PROPOSITION HIS EXTREME YOUTH AND 
HIS WISH TO EXPRESS ALL THAT WAS IN HIS MIND
WHAT REVOLUTION AND REGICIDE A GRAND THING WELL 
AFTER THAT BUT WONT YOU COME TO THIS OTHER TABLE REPEATED 
ANNA PAVLOVNA
ROUSSEAUS CONTRAT SOCIAL SAID THE VICOMTE WITH A TOLER 
ANT SMILE
I AM NOT SPEAKING OF REGICIDE I AM SPEAKING ABOUT 
IDEAS
YES IDEAS OF ROBBERY MURDER AND REGICIDE AGAIN INTER 
JECTED AN IRONICAL VOICE
THOSE WERE EXTREMES NO DOUBT BUT THEY ARE NOT WHAT IS 
MOST IMPORTANT WHAT IS IMPORTANT ARE THE RIGHTS OF MAN 
EMANCIPATION FROM PREJUDICES AND EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP 
AND ALL THESE IDEAS NAPOLEON HAS RETAINED IN FULL FORCE
LIBERTY AND EQUALITY SAID THE VICOMTE CONTEMPTUOUSLY 
AS IF AT LAST DECIDING SERIOUSLY TO PROVE TO THIS YOUTH HOW 
FOOLISH HIS WORDS WERE HIGHSOUNDING WORDS WHICH HAVE 
LONG BEEN DISCREDITED WHO DOES NOT LOVE LIBERTY AND EQUAL 
ITY EVEN OUR SAVIOUR PREACHED LIBERTY AND EQUALITY HAVE 
PEOPLE SINCE THE REVOLUTION BECOME HAPPIER ON THE CON WAR AND PEACE TRARY WE WANTED LIBERTY BUT BUONAPARTE HAS DESTROYED IT
PRINCE ANDREW KEPT LOOKING WITH AN AMUSED SMILE FROM 
PIERRE TO THE VICOMTE AND FROM THE VICOMTE TO THEIR HOSTESS 
IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF PIERRES OUTBURST ANNA PAVLOVNA DE 
SPITE HER SOCIAL EXPERIENCE WAS HORRORSTRUCK BUT WHEN SHE 
SAW THAT PIERRES SACRILEGIOUS WORDS HAD NOT EXASPERATED THE 
VICOMTE AND HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
STOP HIM SHE RALLIED HER FORCES AND JOINED THE VICOMTE IN A 
VIGOROUS ATTACK ON THE ORATOR
BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR PIERRE SAID SHE HOW DO YOU 
EXPLAIN THE FACT OF A GREAT MAN EXECUTING A DUCOR EVEN AN 
ORDINARY MAN WHOIS INNOCENT AND UNTRIED
I SHOULD LIKE SAID THE VICOMTE TO ASK HOW MONSIEUR EX 
PLAINS THE TH BRUMAIRE WAS NOT THAT AN IMPOSTURE IT WAS 
A SWINDLE AND NOT AT ALL LIKE THE CONDUCT OF A GREAT MAN

PIERRE NOT KNOWING WHOM TO ANSWER LOOKED AT THEM 
ALL AND SMILED HIS SMILE WAS UNLIKE THE HALFSMILE OF OTHER 
PEOPLE WHEN HE SMILED HIS GRAVE EVEN RATHER GLOOMY LOOK 
WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY REPLACED BY ANOTHERA CHILDLIKE KINDLY 
EVEN RATHER SILLY LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO ASK FORGIVENESS
THE VICOMTE WHO WAS MEETING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW 
CLEARLY THAT THIS YOUNG JACOBIN WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE AS HIS 
WORDS SUGGESTED ALL WERE SILENT
HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO ANSWER YOU ALL AT ONCE SAID 
PRINCE ANDREW BESIDES IN THE ACTIONS OF A STATESMAN ONE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHAS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIS ACTS AS A PRIVATE PERSON AS A 
GENERAL AND AS AN EMPEROR SO IT SEEMS TO ME
YES YES OF COURSE PIERRE CHIMED IN PLEASED AT THE AR 
RIVAL OF THIS REINFORCEMENT
ONE MUST ADMIT CONTINUED PRINCE ANDREW THAT NA 
POLEON AS A MAN WAS GREAT ON THE BRIDGE OF ARCOLA AND IN 
THE HOSPITAL AT JAFFA WHERE HE GAVE HIS HAND TO THE PLAGUE
STRICKEN BUT BUT THERE ARE OTHER ACTS WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO JUSTIFY
PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD EVIDENTLY WISHED TO TONE DOWN 
THE AWKWARDNESS OF PIERRES REMARKS ROSE AND MADE A SIGN 
TO HIS WIFE THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO
SUDDENLY PRINCE HIPPOLYTE STARTED UP MAKING SIGNS TO 
EVERYONE TO ATTEND AND ASKING THEM ALL TO BE SEATED BEGAN
I WAS TOLD A CHARMING MOSCOW STORY TODAY AND MUST 
TREAT YOU TO IT EXCUSE ME VICOMTEI MUST TELL IT IN RUSSIAN

MILDNESS THAT EXPRESSED FORGIVENESS OF HIS INDISCRETION 
NODDED AND SAID I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN BUT I ALSO HOPE 
YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR OPINIONS MY DEAR MONSIEUR PIERRE

THING IN THE RIGHT LIGHT IN MY OPINION PERPETUAL PEACE IS 
POSSIBLE BUTI DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT NOT BY A BAL 
ANCE OF POLITICAL POWER
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT PRINCE ANDREW WAS NOT INTERESTED IN

LONG FOR HER LEGS LOOKED DIRECTLY AT PRINCE VASILI WITH NO 
SIGN OF EMOTION IN HER PROMINENT GRAY EYES THEN SHE SHOOK 
HER HEAD AND GLANCED UP AT THE ICONS WITH A SIGH THIS MIGHT

OF WEARINESS AND HOPE OF RESTING BEFORE LONG PRINCE VASILI 
UNDERSTOOD IT AS AN EXPRESSION OF WEARINESS

TO HIM AND WOULD ALLOW HIS NOBLE SOUL PEACEFULLY TO LEAVE 
THIS
YES YES OF COURSE INTERRUPTED PRINCE VASILI IMPATIENT 
LY RUBBING HIS BALD HEAD AND ANGRILY PULLING BACK TOWARD 
HIM THE LITTLE TABLE THAT HE HAD PUSHED AWAY BUT IN SHORT 
THE FACT IS YOU KNOW YOURSELF THAT LAST WINTER THE COUNT 
MADE A WILL BY WHICH HE LEFT ALL HIS PROPERTY NOT TO US HIS 
DIRECT HEIRS BUT TO PIERRE
HE HAS MADE WILLS ENOUGH QUIETLY REMARKED THE PRIN

DERSTAND THAT IN CONSIDERATION OF THE COUNTS SERVICES HIS 
REQUEST WOULD BE GRANTED

DOOR WHILE HE WAS GETTING DOWN FROM THE CARRIAGE STEPS 
TWO MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE TRADESPEOPLE RAN HURRIEDLY FROM

THEY WERE ALMOST KNOCKED OVER BY SOME MEN WHO CARRY 
ING PAILS CAME RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS THEIR BOOTS CLATTERING 
THESE MEN PRESSED CLOSE TO THE WALL TO LET PIERRE AND ANNA 
MIKHAYLOVNA PASS AND DID NOT EVINCE THE LEAST SURPRISE AT 
SEEING THEM THERE
IS THIS THE WAY TO THE PRINCESSES APARTMENTS ASKED 
ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OF ONE OF THEM
YES REPLIED A FOOTMAN IN A BOLD LOUD VOICE AS IF ANY 
THING WERE NOW PERMISSIBLE THE DOOR TO THE LEFT MAAM
PERHAPS THE COUNT DID NOT ASK FOR ME SAID PIERRE WHEN 
HE REACHED THE LANDING ID BETTER GO TO MY OWN ROOM
ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA PAUSED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO COME 
UP

PIERRE DID NOT UNDERSTAND A WORD BUT THE CONVICTION 
THAT ALL THIS HAD TO BE GREW STRONGER AND HE MEEKLY FOLLOWED 
ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA WHO WAS ALREADY OPENING A DOORWAR AND PEACE THIS DOOR LED INTO A BACK ANTEROOM AN OLD MAN A SERVANT

GLANCED INTO THE ROOM WHERE PRINCE VASILI AND THE ELDEST 
PRINCESS WERE SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER TALKING SEEING THEM 
PASS PRINCE VASILI DREW BACK WITH OBVIOUS IMPATIENCE 
WHILE THE PRINCESS JUMPED UP AND WITH A GESTURE OF DESPER 
ATION SLAMMED THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT
THIS ACTION WAS SO UNLIKE HER USUAL COMPOSURE AND THE 
FEAR DEPICTED ON PRINCE VASILIS FACE SO OUT OF KEEPING WITH 
HIS DIGNITY THAT PIERRE STOPPED AND GLANCED INQUIRINGLY OVER 
HIS SPECTACLES AT HIS GUIDE ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA EVINCED NO 
SURPRISE SHE ONLY SMILED FAINTLY AND SIGHED AS IF TO SAY THAT

BROTHERS IS ALREADY ABROAD THE OTHER IS WITH THE GUARDS 
WHO ARE STARTING ON THEIR MARCH TO THE FRONTIER OUR DEAR 
EMPEROR HAS LEFT PETERSBURG AND IT IS THOUGHT INTENDS TO EX 
POSE HIS PRECIOUS PERSON TO THE CHANCES OF WAR GOD GRANT 
THAT THE CORSICAN MONSTER WHO IS DESTROYING THE PEACE OF 
EUROPE MAY BE OVERTHROWN BY THE ANGEL WHOM IT HAS PLEASED 
THE ALMIGHTY IN HIS GOODNESS TO GIVE US AS SOVEREIGN TO

REMAIN INACTIVE AND HAS LEFT THE UNIVERSITY TO JOIN THE ARMY 
I WILL CONFESS TO YOU DEAR MARY THAT IN SPITE OF HIS EXTREME 
YOUTH HIS DEPARTURE FOR THE ARMY WAS A GREAT GRIEF TO ME 
THIS YOUNG MAN OF WHOM I SPOKE TO YOU LAST SUMMER IS 
SO NOBLEMINDED AND FULL OF THAT REAL YOUTHFULNESS WHICH 
ONE SELDOM FINDS NOWADAYS AMONG OUR OLD MEN OF TWENTY

MACY WERE WHAT MY HEART NEEDED BUT ENOUGH OF THIS THE 
CHIEF NEWS ABOUT WHICH ALL MOSCOW GOSSIPS IS THE DEATH OF 
OLD COUNT BEZUKHOV AND HIS INHERITANCE FANCY THE THREE 
PRINCESSES HAVE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE PRINCE VASILI NOTHING 
AND IT IS MONSIEUR PIERRE WHO HAS INHERITED ALL THE PROPERTY 
AND HAS BESIDES BEEN RECOGNIZED AS LEGITIMATE SO THAT HE IS 
NOW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND POSSESSOR OF THE FINEST FORTUNE IN 
RUSSIA IT IS RUMORED THAT PRINCE VASILI PLAYED A VERY DESPI 
CABLE PART IN THIS AFFAIR AND THAT HE RETURNED TO PETERSBURG 
QUITE CRESTFALLEN
I CONFESS I UNDERSTAND VERY LITTLE ABOUT ALL THESE MATTERS 
OF WILLS AND INHERITANCE BUT I DO KNOW THAT SINCE THIS YOUNG 
MAN WHOM WE ALL USED TO KNOW AS PLAIN MONSIEUR PIERRE 
HAS BECOME COUNT BEZUKHOV AND THE OWNER OF ONE OF THE 
LARGEST FORTUNES IN RUSSIA I AM MUCH AMUSED TO WATCH THE 
CHANGE IN THE TONE AND MANNERS OF THE MAMMAS BURDENED 
BY MARRIAGEABLE DAUGHTERS AND OF THE YOUNG LADIES THEM 
SELVES TOWARD HIM THOUGH BETWEEN YOU AND ME HE ALWAYS 
SEEMED TO ME A POOR SORT OF FELLOW AS FOR THE PAST TWO 
YEARS PEOPLE HAVE AMUSED THEMSELVES BY FINDING HUSBANDS 
FOR ME MOST OF WHOM I DONT EVEN KNOW THE MATCHMAK 
ING CHRONICLES OF MOSCOW NOW SPEAK OF ME AS THE FUTURE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCOUNTESS BEZUKHOVA BUT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE 
NO DESIRE FOR THE POST A PROPOS OF MARRIAGES DO YOU KNOW 
THAT A WHILE AGO THAT UNIVERSAL AUNTIE ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA 
TOLD ME UNDER THE SEAL OF STRICT SECRECY OF A PLAN OF MAR 
RIAGE FOR YOU IT IS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN WITH PRINCE 
VASILIS SON ANATOLE WHOM THEY WISH TO REFORM BY MARRY 
ING HIM TO SOMEONE RICH AND DISTINGUEE AND IT IS ON YOU 
THAT HIS RELATIONS CHOICE HAS FALLEN I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU 
WILL THINK OF IT BUT I CONSIDER IT MY DUTY TO LET YOU KNOW OF

JULIE
PS LET ME HAVE NEWS OF YOUR BROTHER AND HIS CHARMING 
LITTLE WIFE
THE PRINCESS PONDERED AWHILE WITH A THOUGHTFUL SMILE 
AND HER LUMINOUS EYES LIT UP SO THAT HER FACE WAS ENTIRELY 
TRANSFORMED THEN SHE SUDDENLY ROSE AND WITH HER HEAVY 
TREAD WENT UP TO THE TABLE SHE TOOK A SHEET OF PAPER AND HER 
HAND MOVED RAPIDLY OVER IT THIS IS THE REPLY SHE WROTE ALSO 
IN FRENCH
DEAR AND PRECIOUS FRIEND YOUR LETTER OF THE TH HAS GIV WAR AND PEACE EN ME GREAT DELIGHT SO YOU STILL LOVE ME MY ROMANTIC JULIE 
SEPARATION OF WHICH YOU SAY SO MUCH THAT IS BAD DOES NOT 
SEEM TO HAVE HAD ITS USUAL EFFECT ON YOU YOU COMPLAIN OF 
OUR SEPARATION WHAT THEN SHOULD I SAY IF I DARED COMPLAIN 
I WHO AM DEPRIVED OF ALL WHO ARE DEAR TO ME AH IF WE HAD 
NOT RELIGION TO CONSOLE US LIFE WOULD BE VERY SAD WHY DO 
YOU SUPPOSE THAT I SHOULD LOOK SEVERELY ON YOUR AFFECTION 
FOR THAT YOUNG MAN ON SUCH MATTERS I AM ONLY SEVERE WITH 
MYSELF I UNDERSTAND SUCH FEELINGS IN OTHERS AND IF NEVER 
HAVING FELT THEM I CANNOT APPROVE OF THEM NEITHER DO I CON 
DEMN THEM ONLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CHRISTIAN LOVE LOVE 
OF ONES NEIGHBOR LOVE OF ONES ENEMY IS WORTHIER SWEETER 
AND BETTER THAN THE FEELINGS WHICH THE BEAUTIFUL EYES OF A 
YOUNG MAN CAN INSPIRE IN A ROMANTIC AND LOVING YOUNG GIRL 
LIKE YOURSELF
THE NEWS OF COUNT BEZUKHOVS DEATH REACHED US BEFORE 
YOUR LETTER AND MY FATHER WAS MUCH AFFECTED BY IT HE SAYS 
THE COUNT WAS THE LAST REPRESENTATIVE BUT ONE OF THE GREAT 
CENTURY AND THAT IT IS HIS OWN TURN NOW BUT THAT HE WILL DO 
ALL HE CAN TO LET HIS TURN COME AS LATE AS POSSIBLE GOD PRE 
SERVE US FROM THAT TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE
I CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT PIERRE WHOM I KNEW AS A 
CHILD HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME TO HAVE AN EXCELLENT HEART 
AND THAT IS THE QUALITY I VALUE MOST IN PEOPLE AS TO HIS IN 
HERITANCE AND THE PART PLAYED BY PRINCE VASILI IT IS VERY SAD 
FOR BOTH AH MY DEAR FRIEND OUR DIVINE SAVIOURS WORDS 
THAT IT IS EASIER FOR A CAMEL TO GO THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE 
THAN FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD ARE TER 
RIBLY TRUE I PITY PRINCE VASILI BUT AM STILL MORE SORRY FOR  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMPIERRE SO YOUNG AND BURDENED WITH SUCH RICHESTO WHAT 
TEMPTATIONS HE WILL BE EXPOSED IF I WERE ASKED WHAT I DE 
SIRE MOST ON EARTH IT WOULD BE TO BE POORER THAN THE POOREST 
BEGGAR A THOUSAND THANKS DEAR FRIEND FOR THE VOLUME 
YOU HAVE SENT ME AND WHICH HAS SUCH SUCCESS IN MOSCOW 
YET SINCE YOU TELL ME THAT AMONG SOME GOOD THINGS IT CON 
TAINS OTHERS WHICH OUR WEAK HUMAN UNDERSTANDING CANNOT 
GRASP IT SEEMS TO ME RATHER USELESS TO SPEND TIME IN READ 
ING WHAT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND CAN THEREFORE BEAR NO FRUIT I 
NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND THE FONDNESS SOME PEOPLE HAVE FOR 
CONFUSING THEIR MINDS BY DWELLING ON MYSTICAL BOOKS THAT 
MERELY AWAKEN THEIR DOUBTS AND EXCITE THEIR IMAGINATION 
GIVING THEM A BENT FOR EXAGGERATION QUITE CONTRARY TO CHRIS 
TIAN SIMPLICITY LET US RATHER READ THE EPISTLES AND GOSPELS 
LET US NOT SEEK TO PENETRATE WHAT MYSTERIES THEY CONTAIN FOR 
HOW CAN WE MISERABLE SINNERS THAT WE ARE KNOW THE TER 
RIBLE AND HOLY SECRETS OF PROVIDENCE WHILE WE REMAIN IN THIS 
FLESH WHICH FORMS AN IMPENETRABLE VEIL BETWEEN US AND THE 
ETERNAL LET US RATHER CONFINE OURSELVES TO STUDYING THOSE 
SUBLIME RULES WHICH OUR DIVINE SAVIOUR HAS LEFT FOR OUR 
GUIDANCE HERE BELOW LET US TRY TO CONFORM TO THEM AND FOL 
LOW THEM AND LET US BE PERSUADED THAT THE LESS WE LET OUR 
FEEBLE HUMAN MINDS ROAM THE BETTER WE SHALL PLEASE GOD 
WHO REJECTS ALL KNOWLEDGE THAT DOES NOT COME FROM HIM 
AND THE LESS WE SEEK TO FATHOM WHAT HE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO 
CONCEAL FROM US THE SOONER WILL HE VOUCHSAFE ITS REVELATION 
TO US THROUGH HIS DIVINE SPIRIT
MY FATHER HAS NOT SPOKEN TO ME OF A SUITOR BUT HAS ONLY 
TOLD ME THAT HE HAS RECEIVED A LETTER AND IS EXPECTING A VISIT WAR AND PEACE FROM PRINCE VASILI IN REGARD TO THIS PROJECT OF MARRIAGE FOR 
ME I WILL TELL YOU DEAR SWEET FRIEND THAT I LOOK ON MARRIAGE 
AS A DIVINE INSTITUTION TO WHICH WE MUST CONFORM HOWEVER 
PAINFUL IT MAY BE TO ME SHOULD THE ALMIGHTY LAY THE DUTIES 
OF WIFE AND WIFE AND MOTHER UPON ME I SHALL TRY TO PERFORM 
THEM AS FAITHFULLY AS I CAN WITHOUT DISQUIETING MYSELF BY 
EXAMINING MY FEELINGS TOWARD HIM WHOM HE MAY GIVE ME 
FOR HUSBAND
I HAVE HAD A LETTER FROM MY BROTHER WHO ANNOUNCES HIS 
SPEEDY ARRIVAL AT BALD HILLS WITH HIS WIFE THIS PLEASURE WILL 
BE BUT A BRIEF ONE HOWEVER FOR HE WILL LEAVE US AGAIN TO TAKE

IN OCTOBER  A RUSSIAN ARMY WAS OCCUPYING THE VIL 
LAGES AND TOWNS OF THE ARCHDUCHY OF AUSTRIA AND YET OTHER 
REGIMENTS FRESHLY ARRIVING FROM RUSSIA WERE SETTLING NEAR 
THE FORTRESS OF BRAUNAU AND BURDENING THE INHABITANTS ON 
WHOM THEY WERE QUARTERED BRAUNAU WAS THE HEADQUARTERS 
OF THE COMMANDERINCHIEF KUTUZOV
ON OCTOBER   ONE OF THE INFANTRY REGIMENTS THAT 
HAD JUST REACHED BRAUNAU HAD HALTED HALF A MILE FROM THE 
TOWN WAITING TO BE INSPECTED BY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
DESPITE THE UNRUSSIAN APPEARANCE OF THE LOCALITY AND SUR 
ROUNDINGSFRUIT GARDENS STONE FENCES TILED ROOFS AND HILLS 
IN THE DISTANCEAND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE INHABITANTS WHO 
GAZED WITH CURIOSITY AT THE SOLDIERS WERE NOT RUSSIANS THE 
REGIMENT HAD JUST THE APPEARANCE OF ANY RUSSIAN REGIMENT 
PREPARING FOR AN INSPECTION ANYWHERE IN THE HEART OF RUS 
SIA
ON THE EVENING OF THE LAST DAYS MARCH AN ORDER HAD BEEN 
RECEIVED THAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WOULD INSPECT THE 
REGIMENT ON THE MARCH THOUGH THE WORDS OF THE ORDER WERE 
NOT CLEAR TO THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER AND THE QUESTION 
AROSE WHETHER THE TROOPS WERE TO BE IN MARCHING ORDER OR 
NOT IT WAS DECIDED AT A CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE BATTALION 
COMMANDERS TO PRESENT THE REGIMENT IN PARADE ORDER ON 
THE PRINCIPLE THAT IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BOW TOO LOW THAN  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMNOT BOW LOW ENOUGH SO THE SOLDIERS AFTER A TWENTYMILE 
MARCH WERE KEPT MENDING AND CLEANING ALL NIGHT LONG 
WITHOUT CLOSING THEIR EYES WHILE THE ADJUTANTS AND COMPA 
NY COMMANDERS CALCULATED AND RECKONED AND BY MORNING 
THE REGIMENTINSTEAD OF THE STRAGGLING DISORDERLY CROWD IT 
HAD BEEN ON ITS LAST MARCH THE DAY BEFOREPRESENTED A WELL
ORDERED ARRAY OF TWO THOUSAND MEN EACH OF WHOM KNEW HIS 
PLACE AND HIS DUTY HAD EVERY BUTTON AND EVERY STRAP IN PLACE 
AND SHONE WITH CLEANLINESS AND NOT ONLY EXTERNALLY WAS ALL 
IN ORDER BUT HAD IT PLEASED THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF TO LOOK 
UNDER THE UNIFORMS HE WOULD HAVE FOUND ON EVERY MAN A 
CLEAN SHIRT AND IN EVERY KNAPSACK THE APPOINTED NUMBER 
OF ARTICLES AWL SOAP AND ALL AS THE SOLDIERS SAY THERE WAS 
ONLY ONE CIRCUMSTANCE CONCERNING WHICH NO ONE COULD BE 
AT EASE IT WAS THE STATE OF THE SOLDIERS BOOTS MORE THAN HALF 
THE MENS BOOTS WERE IN HOLES BUT THIS DEFECT WAS NOT DUE 
TO ANY FAULT OF THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER FOR IN SPITE OF RE 
PEATED DEMANDS BOOTS HAD NOT BEEN ISSUED BY THE AUSTRIAN 
COMMISSARIAT AND THE REGIMENT HAD MARCHED SOME SEVEN 
HUNDRED MILES
THE COMMANDER OF THE REGIMENT WAS AN ELDERLY CHO 
LERIC STOUT AND THICKSET GENERAL WITH GRIZZLED EYEBROWS 
AND WHISKERS AND WIDER FROM CHEST TO BACK THAN ACROSS THE 
SHOULDERS HE HAD ON A BRANDNEW UNIFORM SHOWING THE 
CREASES WHERE IT HAD BEEN FOLDED AND THICK GOLD EPAULETTES 
WHICH SEEMED TO STAND RATHER THAN LIE DOWN ON HIS MASSIVE 
SHOULDERS HE HAD THE AIR OF A MAN HAPPILY PERFORMING ONE 
OF THE MOST SOLEMN DUTIES OF HIS LIFE HE WALKED ABOUT IN 
FRONT OF THE LINE AND AT EVERY STEP PULLED HIMSELF UP SLIGHTLY WAR AND PEACE ARCHING HIS BACK IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE COMMANDER ADMIRED 
HIS REGIMENT REJOICED IN IT AND THAT HIS WHOLE MIND WAS EN 
GROSSED BY IT YET HIS STRUT SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT BESIDES 
MILITARY MATTERS SOCIAL INTERESTS AND THE FAIR SEX OCCUPIED 
NO SMALL PART OF HIS THOUGHTS

VIEW TO SHOW THE AUSTRIAN GENERAL THE WRETCHED STATE IN  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWHICH THE TROOPS ARRIVED FROM RUSSIA WITH THIS OBJECT HE 
INTENDED TO MEET THE REGIMENT SO THE WORSE THE CONDITION

BE THOUGH THE AIDEDECAMP DID NOT KNOW THESE CIRCUM 
STANCES HE NEVERTHELESS DELIVERED THE DEFINITE ORDER THAT THE 
MEN SHOULD BE IN THEIR GREATCOATS AND IN MARCHING ORDER

COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND DEVOURED HIM WITH HIS EYES DRAW 
ING HIMSELF UP OBSEQUIOUSLY AND FROM THE WAY HE WALKED 
THROUGH THE RANKS BEHIND THE GENERALS BENDING FORWARD 
AND HARDLY ABLE TO RESTRAIN HIS JERKY MOVEMENTS AND FROM 
THE WAY HE DARTED FORWARD AT EVERY WORD OR GESTURE OF THE 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE PERFORMED HIS 
DUTY AS A SUBORDINATE WITH EVEN GREATER ZEAL THAN HIS DUTY AS 
A COMMANDER THANKS TO THE STRICTNESS AND ASSIDUITY OF ITS 
COMMANDER THE REGIMENT IN COMPARISON WITH OTHERS THAT 
HAD REACHED BRAUNAU AT THE SAME TIME WAS IN SPLENDID CON 
DITION THERE WERE ONLY  SICK AND STRAGGLERS EVERYTHING 
WAS IN GOOD ORDER EXCEPT THE BOOTS
KUTUZOV WALKED THROUGH THE RANKS SOMETIMES STOP

HANDSOME FACE AND MOIST EYES NESVITSKI COULD HARDLY KEEP 
FROM LAUGHTER PROVOKED BY A SWARTHY HUSSAR OFFICER WHO 
WALKED BESIDE HIM THIS HUSSAR WITH A GRAVE FACE AND WITH

WATCHED THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDERS BACK AND MIMICKED

BENT FORWARD THE HUSSAR STARTED AND BENT FORWARD IN EX 
ACTLY THE SAME MANNER NESVITSKI LAUGHED AND NUDGED THE

AH TIMOKHIN SAID HE RECOGNIZING THE REDNOSED CAP 
TAIN WHO HAD BEEN REPRIMANDED ON ACCOUNT OF THE BLUE 
GREATCOAT
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO STRETCH 
HIMSELF MORE THAN TIMOKHIN HAD DONE WHEN HE WAS REPRI 
MANDED BY THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER BUT NOW THAT THE 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF ADDRESSED HIM HE DREW HIMSELF UP TO 
SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT SEEMED HE COULD NOT HAVE SUSTAINED IT 
HAD THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF CONTINUED TO LOOK AT HIM AND WAR AND PEACE SO KUTUZOV WHO EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HIS CASE AND WISHED 
HIM NOTHING BUT GOOD QUICKLY TURNED AWAY A SCARCELY PER 
CEPTIBLE SMILE FLITTING OVER HIS SCARRED AND PUFFY FACE
ANOTHER ISMAIL COMRADE SAID HE A BRAVE OFFICER ARE 
YOU SATISFIED WITH HIM HE ASKED THE REGIMENTAL COMMAND

AND THE LATTERUNCONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS BEING REFLECTED IN 
THE HUSSAR OFFICER AS IN A LOOKING GLASSSTARTED MOVED FOR 
WARD AND ANSWERED HIGHLY SATISFIED YOUR EXCELLENCY
WE ALL HAVE OUR WEAKNESSES SAID KUTUZOV SMILING AND 
WALKING AWAY FROM HIM HE USED TO HAVE A PREDILECTION FOR 
BACCHUS
THE REGIMENTAL COMMANDER WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT BE 
BLAMED FOR THIS AND DID NOT ANSWER THE HUSSAR AT THAT MO 
MENT NOTICED THE FACE OF THE REDNOSED CAPTAIN AND HIS 
DRAWNIN STOMACH AND MIMICKED HIS EXPRESSION AND POSE 
WITH SUCH EXACTITUDE THAT NESVITSKI COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING 
KUTUZOV TURNED ROUND THE OFFICER EVIDENTLY HAD COMPLETE 
CONTROL OF HIS FACE AND WHILE KUTUZOV WAS TURNING MAN 
AGED TO MAKE A GRIMACE AND THEN ASSUME A MOST SERIOUS 
DEFERENTIAL AND INNOCENT EXPRESSION
THE THIRD COMPANY WAS THE LAST AND KUTUZOV PONDERED 
APPARENTLY TRYING TO RECOLLECT SOMETHING PRINCE ANDREW 
STEPPED FORWARD FROM AMONG THE SUITE AND SAID IN FRENCH
YOU TOLD ME TO REMIND YOU OF THE OFFICER DOLOKHOV RE

TION THAT SEPARATES A COMMANDER IN CHIEF SO WIDELY FROM A

ONE THING I ASK OF YOUR EXCELLENCY DOLOKHOV SAID IN 
HIS FIRM RINGING DELIBERATE VOICE I ASK AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
ATONE FOR MY FAULT AND PROVE MY DEVOTION TO HIS MAJESTY THE

OF EXPRESSION AND INTONATION THAT OBLIGED ONE TO LISTEN TO 
EACH DELIBERATELY SPOKEN WORD IT WAS EVIDENT THAT KUTUZOV 
HIMSELF LISTENED WITH PLEASURE TO HIS OWN VOICE ALL I CAN 
SAY GENERAL IS THAT IF THE MATTER DEPENDED ON MY PERSONAL 
WISHES THE WILL OF HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR FRANCIS WOULD 
HAVE BEEN FULFILLED LONG AGO I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE JOINED 
THE ARCHDUKE AND BELIEVE ME ON MY HONOUR THAT TO ME 
PERSONALLY IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE TO HAND OVER THE SUPREME 
COMMAND OF THE ARMY INTO THE HANDS OF A BETTER INFORMED 
AND MORE SKILLFUL GENERALOF WHOM AUSTRIA HAS SO MANYAND 
TO LAY DOWN ALL THIS HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY BUT CIRCUMSTANCES  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMARE SOMETIMES TOO STRONG FOR US GENERAL
AND KUTUZOV SMILED IN A WAY THAT SEEMED TO SAY YOU 
ARE QUITE AT LIBERTY NOT TO BELIEVE ME AND I DONT EVEN CARE 
WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT BUT YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR TELLING 
ME SO AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
THE AUSTRIAN GENERAL LOOKED DISSATISFIED BUT HAD NO OP 
TION BUT TO REPLY IN THE SAME TONE
ON THE CONTRARY HE SAID IN A QUERULOUS AND ANGRY 
TONE THAT CONTRASTED WITH HIS FLATTERING WORDS ON THE CON 
TRARY YOUR EXCELLENCYS PARTICIPATION IN THE COMMON ACTION 
IS HIGHLY VALUED BY HIS MAJESTY BUT WE THINK THE PRESENT 
DELAY IS DEPRIVING THE SPLENDID RUSSIAN TROOPS AND THEIR 
COMMANDER OF THE LAURELS THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO 
WIN IN THEIR BATTLES HE CONCLUDED HIS EVIDENTLY PREARRANGED 
SENTENCE
KUTUZOV BOWED WITH THE SAME SMILE
BUT THAT IS MY CONVICTION AND JUDGING BY THE LAST LET 
TER WITH WHICH HIS HIGHNESS THE ARCHDUKE FERDINAND HAS 
HONORED ME I IMAGINE THAT THE AUSTRIAN TROOPS UNDER THE 
DIRECTION OF SO SKILLFUL A LEADER AS GENERAL MACK HAVE BY 
NOW ALREADY GAINED A DECISIVE VICTORY AND NO LONGER NEED 
OUR AID SAID KUTUZOV
THE GENERAL FROWNED THOUGH THERE WAS NO DEFINITE NEWS 
OF AN AUSTRIAN DEFEAT THERE WERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES CON 
FIRMING THE UNFAVORABLE RUMORS THAT WERE AFLOAT AND SO 
KUTUZOVS SUGGESTION OF AN AUSTRIAN VICTORY SOUNDED MUCH 
LIKE IRONY BUT KUTUZOV WENT ON BLANDLY SMILING WITH THE 
SAME EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO SAY THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO 
SUPPOSE SO AND IN FACT THE LAST LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED FROM WAR AND PEACE MACKS ARMY INFORMED HIM OF A VICTORY AND STATED STRATEGI 
CALLY THE POSITION OF THE ARMY WAS VERY FAVORABLE
GIVE ME THAT LETTER SAID KUTUZOV TURNING TO PRINCE AN 
DREW PLEASE HAVE A LOOK AT ITAND KUTUZOV WITH AN IRONICAL 
SMILE ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH READ TO THE AUSTRIAN 
GENERAL THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IN GERMAN FROM THE ARCH 
DUKE FERDINANDS LETTER
WE HAVE FULLY CONCENTRATED FORCES OF NEARLY SEVENTY 
THOUSAND MEN WITH WHICH TO ATTACK AND DEFEAT THE ENEMY 
SHOULD HE CROSS THE LECH ALSO AS WE ARE MASTERS OF ULM WE 
CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF THE ADVANTAGE OF COMMANDING BOTH 
SIDES OF THE DANUBE SO THAT SHOULD THE ENEMY NOT CROSS THE 
LECH WE CAN CROSS THE DANUBE THROW OURSELVES ON HIS LINE 
OF COMMUNICATIONS RECROSS THE RIVER LOWER DOWN AND FRUS 
TRATE HIS INTENTION SHOULD HE TRY TO DIRECT HIS WHOLE FORCE 
AGAINST OUR FAITHFUL ALLY WE SHALL THEREFORE CONFIDENTLY 
AWAIT THE MOMENT WHEN THE IMPERIAL RUSSIAN ARMY WILL BE 
FULLY EQUIPPED AND SHALL THEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH IT EASILY 
FIND A WAY TO PREPARE FOR THE ENEMY THE FATE HE DESERVES
KUTUZOV SIGHED DEEPLY ON FINISHING THIS PARAGRAPH AND 
LOOKED AT THE MEMBER OF THE HOFKRIEGSRATH MILDLY AND AT 
TENTIVELY
BUT YOU KNOW THE WISE MAXIM YOUR EXCELLENCY ADVISING 
ONE TO EXPECT THE WORST SAID THE AUSTRIAN GENERAL EVIDENT 
LY WISHING TO HAVE DONE WITH JESTS AND TO COME TO BUSINESS 
HE INVOLUNTARILY LOOKED ROUND AT THE AIDEDECAMP
EXCUSE ME GENERAL INTERRUPTED KUTUZOV ALSO TURN 
ING TO PRINCE ANDREW LOOK HERE MY DEAR FELLOW GET FROM 
KOZLOVSKI ALL THE REPORTS FROM OUR SCOUTS HERE ARE TWO  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMLETTERS FROM COUNT NOSTITZ AND HERE IS ONE FROM HIS HIGH 
NESS THE ARCHDUKE FERDINAND AND HERE ARE THESE HE SAID 
HANDING HIM SEVERAL PAPERS MAKE A NEAT MEMORANDUM IN 
FRENCH OUT OF ALL THIS SHOWING ALL THE NEWS WE HAVE HAD OF 
THE MOVEMENTS OF THE AUSTRIAN ARMY AND THEN GIVE IT TO HIS 
EXCELLENCY
PRINCE ANDREW BOWED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF HAVING UN 
DERSTOOD FROM THE FIRST NOT ONLY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID BUT ALSO 
WHAT KUTUZOV WOULD HAVE LIKED TO TELL HIM HE GATHERED UP 
THE PAPERS AND WITH A BOW TO BOTH STEPPED SOFTLY OVER THE 
CARPET AND WENT OUT INTO THE WAITING ROOM
THOUGH NOT MUCH TIME HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW 
HAD LEFT RUSSIA HE HAD CHANGED GREATLY DURING THAT PERIOD 
IN THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE IN HIS MOVEMENTS IN HIS WALK 
SCARCELY A TRACE WAS LEFT OF HIS FORMER AFFECTED LANGUOR AND 
INDOLENCE HE NOW LOOKED LIKE A MAN WHO HAS TIME TO THINK 
OF THE IMPRESSION HE MAKES ON OTHERS BUT IS OCCUPIED WITH 
AGREEABLE AND INTERESTING WORK HIS FACE EXPRESSED MORE 
SATISFACTION WITH HIMSELF AND THOSE AROUND HIM HIS SMILE 
AND GLANCE WERE BRIGHTER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE
KUTUZOV WHOM HE HAD OVERTAKEN IN POLAND HAD RECEIVED 
HIM VERY KINDLY PROMISED NOT TO FORGET HIM DISTINGUISHED 
HIM ABOVE THE OTHER ADJUTANTS AND HAD TAKEN HIM TO VI 
ENNA AND GIVEN HIM THE MORE SERIOUS COMMISSIONS FROM 
VIENNA KUTUZOV WROTE TO HIS OLD COMRADE PRINCE ANDREWS 
FATHER
YOUR SON BIDS FAIR TO BECOME AN OFFICER DISTINGUISHED BY 
HIS INDUSTRY FIRMNESS AND EXPEDITION I CONSIDER MYSELF 
FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUCH A SUBORDINATE BY MEWAR AND PEACE ON KUTUZOVS STAFF AMONG HIS FELLOW OFFICERS AND IN THE 
ARMY GENERALLY PRINCE ANDREW HAD AS HE HAD HAD IN PE 
TERSBURG SOCIETY TWO QUITE OPPOSITE REPUTATIONS SOME A 
MINORITY ACKNOWLEDGED HIM TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THEM 
SELVES AND FROM EVERYONE ELSE EXPECTED GREAT THINGS OF HIM 
LISTENED TO HIM ADMIRED AND IMITATED HIM AND WITH THEM 
PRINCE ANDREW WAS NATURAL AND PLEASANT OTHERS THE MA 
JORITY DISLIKED HIM AND CONSIDERED HIM CONCEITED COLD AND 
DISAGREEABLE BUT AMONG THESE PEOPLE PRINCE ANDREW KNEW 
HOW TO TAKE HIS STAND SO THAT THEY RESPECTED AND EVEN FEARED 
HIM
COMING OUT OF KUTUZOVS ROOM INTO THE WAITING ROOM 
WITH THE PAPERS IN HIS HAND PRINCE ANDREW CAME UP TO HIS 
COMRADE THE AIDEDECAMP ON DUTY KOZLOVSKI WHO WAS 
SITTING AT THE WINDOW WITH A BOOK
WELL PRINCE ASKED KOZLOVSKI
I AM ORDERED TO WRITE A MEMORANDUM EXPLAINING WHY 
WE ARE NOT ADVANCING
AND WHY IS IT
PRINCE ANDREW SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
ANY NEWS FROM MACK
NO
IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE HAS BEEN BEATEN NEWS WOULD HAVE 
COME
PROBABLY SAID PRINCE ANDREW MOVING TOWARD THE OUTER 
DOOR
BUT AT THAT INSTANT A TALL AUSTRIAN GENERAL IN A GREATCOAT 
WITH THE ORDER OF MARIA THERESA ON HIS NECK AND A BLACK 
BANDAGE ROUND HIS HEAD WHO HAD EVIDENTLY JUST ARRIVED EN  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMTERED QUICKLY SLAMMING THE DOOR PRINCE ANDREW STOPPED 
SHORT
COMMANDER IN CHIEF KUTUZOV SAID THE NEWLY ARRIVED 
GENERAL SPEAKING QUICKLY WITH A HARSH GERMAN ACCENT 
LOOKING TO BOTH SIDES AND ADVANCING STRAIGHT TOWARD THE IN 
NER DOOR
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS ENGAGED SAID KOZLOVSKI GO 
ING HURRIEDLY UP TO THE UNKNOWN GENERAL AND BLOCKING HIS 
WAY TO THE DOOR WHOM SHALL I ANNOUNCE
THE UNKNOWN GENERAL LOOKED DISDAINFULLY DOWN AT KO 
ZLOVSKI WHO WAS RATHER SHORT AS IF SURPRISED THAT ANYONE 
SHOULD NOT KNOW HIM
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS ENGAGED REPEATED KOZLOVSKI 
CALMLY
THE GENERALS FACE CLOUDED HIS LIPS QUIVERED AND TREM 
BLED HE TOOK OUT A NOTEBOOK HURRIEDLY SCRIBBLED SOMETHING 
IN PENCIL TORE OUT THE LEAF GAVE IT TO KOZLOVSKI STEPPED 
QUICKLY TO THE WINDOW AND THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR GAZ 
ING AT THOSE IN THE ROOM AS IF ASKING WHY DO THEY LOOK 
AT ME THEN HE LIFTED HIS HEAD STRETCHED HIS NECK AS IF HE 
INTENDED TO SAY SOMETHING BUT IMMEDIATELY WITH AFFECTED 
INDIFFERENCE BEGAN TO HUM TO HIMSELF PRODUCING A QUEER 
SOUND WHICH IMMEDIATELY BROKE OFF THE DOOR OF THE PRI 
VATE ROOM OPENED AND KUTUZOV APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY 
THE GENERAL WITH THE BANDAGED HEAD BENT FORWARD AS THOUGH 
RUNNING AWAY FROM SOME DANGER AND MAKING LONG QUICK 
STRIDES WITH HIS THIN LEGS WENT UP TO KUTUZOV
VOUS VOYEZ LE MALHEUREUX MACK HE UTTERED IN A BROKEN 
VOICEWAR AND PEACE KUTUZOVS FACE AS HE STOOD IN THE OPEN DOORWAY REMAINED 
PERFECTLY IMMOBILE FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEN WRINKLES RAN 
OVER HIS FACE LIKE A WAVE AND HIS FOREHEAD BECAME SMOOTH 
AGAIN HE BOWED HIS HEAD RESPECTFULLY CLOSED HIS EYES SI 
LENTLY LET MACK ENTER HIS ROOM BEFORE HIM AND CLOSED THE 
DOOR HIMSELF BEHIND HIM
THE REPORT WHICH HAD BEEN CIRCULATED THAT THE AUSTRIANS 
HAD BEEN BEATEN AND THAT THE WHOLE ARMY HAD SURRENDERED 
AT ULM PROVED TO BE CORRECT WITHIN HALF AN HOUR ADJU 
TANTS HAD BEEN SENT IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS WITH ORDERS WHICH 
SHOWED THAT THE RUSSIAN TROOPS WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN IN 
ACTIVE WOULD ALSO SOON HAVE TO MEET THE ENEMY
PRINCE ANDREW WAS ONE OF THOSE RARE STAFF OFFICERS WHOSE 
CHIEF INTEREST LAY IN THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF THE WAR WHEN 
HE SAW MACK AND HEARD THE DETAILS OF HIS DISASTER HE UN 
DERSTOOD THAT HALF THE CAMPAIGN WAS LOST UNDERSTOOD ALL 
THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE RUSSIAN ARMYS POSITION AND VIVID 
LY IMAGINED WHAT AWAITED IT AND THE PART HE WOULD HAVE TO 
PLAY INVOLUNTARILY HE FELT A JOYFUL AGITATION AT THE THOUGHT 
OF THE HUMILIATION OF ARROGANT AUSTRIA AND THAT IN A WEEKS 
TIME HE MIGHT PERHAPS SEE AND TAKE PART IN THE FIRST RUS 
SIAN ENCOUNTER WITH THE FRENCH SINCE SUVOROV MET THEM HE 
FEARED THAT BONAPARTES GENIUS MIGHT OUTWEIGH ALL THE COUR 
AGE OF THE RUSSIAN TROOPS AND AT THE SAME TIME COULD NOT 
ADMIT THE IDEA OF HIS HERO BEING DISGRACED
EXCITED AND IRRITATED BY THESE THOUGHTS PRINCE ANDREW 
WENT TOWARD HIS ROOM TO WRITE TO HIS FATHER TO WHOM HE 
WROTE EVERY DAY IN THE CORRIDOR HE MET NESVITSKI WITH

ZHERKOV PUSHING NESVITSKI ASIDE WITH HIS ARM SAID IN A 
BREATHLESS VOICE

THE GENERALS WERE PASSING BY LOOKING AS IF THEY WISHED 
TO AVOID EMBARRASSING ATTENTIONS ON THE FACE OF THE WAG 
ZHERKOV THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED A STUPID SMILE OF GLEE 
WHICH HE SEEMED UNABLE TO SUPPRESS

HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND SCRAPED FIRST WITH ONE FOOT AND 
THEN WITH THE OTHER AWKWARDLY LIKE A CHILD AT A DANCING

ARRIVED QUITE WELL ONLY A LITTLE BRUISED JUST HERE HE ADDED 
POINTING WITH A BEAMING SMILE TO HIS HEAD

NESVITSKI WITH A LAUGH THREW HIS ARMS ROUND PRINCE AN 
DREW BUT BOLKONSKI TURNING STILL PALER PUSHED HIM AWAY 
WITH AN ANGRY LOOK AND TURNED TO ZHERKOV THE NERVOUS IR

DEFEAT AND THE THOUGHT OF WHAT LAY BEFORE THE RUSSIAN ARMY 
FOUND VENT IN ANGER AT ZHERKOVS UNTIMELY JEST
IF YOU SIR CHOOSE TO MAKE A BUFFOON OF YOURSELF HE SAID

WITH WHICH THE RUSSIANS FOUGHT THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF 
THESE ACTIONS WAS A YET MORE RAPID RETREAT AUSTRIAN TROOPS

COMMODATE ALL THE SICK AND WOUNDED YET THE STAND MADE 
AT KREMS AND THE VICTORY OVER MORTIER RAISED THE SPIRITS OF

PRINCE ANDREW FELT THAT EITHER THE ACTIONS OF KUTUZOVS 
ARMY INTERESTED THE MINISTER OF WAR LESS THAN ANY OF THE 
OTHER MATTERS HE WAS CONCERNED WITH OR HE WANTED TO GIVE 
THE RUSSIAN SPECIAL MESSENGER THAT IMPRESSION BUT THAT IS A 
MATTER OF PERFECT INDIFFERENCE TO ME HE THOUGHT THE MIN 
ISTER DREW THE REMAINING PAPERS TOGETHER ARRANGED THEM 
EVENLY AND THEN RAISED HIS HEAD HE HAD AN INTELLECTUAL AND 
DISTINCTIVE HEAD BUT THE INSTANT HE TURNED TO PRINCE AN 
DREW THE FIRM INTELLIGENT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE CHANGED 
IN A WAY EVIDENTLY DELIBERATE AND HABITUAL TO HIM HIS FACE 
TOOK ON THE STUPID ARTIFICIAL SMILE WHICH DOES NOT EVEN AT 
TEMPT TO HIDE ITS ARTIFICIALITY OF A MAN WHO IS CONTINUALLY 
RECEIVING MANY PETITIONERS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
FROM GENERAL FIELD MARSHAL KUTUZOV HE ASKED I HOPE 
IT IS GOOD NEWS THERE HAS BEEN AN ENCOUNTER WITH MORTIER 
A VICTORY IT WAS HIGH TIME
HE TOOK THE DISPATCH WHICH WAS ADDRESSED TO HIM AND WAR AND PEACE BEGAN TO READ IT WITH A MOURNFUL EXPRESSION
OH MY GOD MY GOD SCHMIDT HE EXCLAIMED IN GER 
MAN WHAT A CALAMITY WHAT A CALAMITY
HAVING GLANCED THROUGH THE DISPATCH HE LAID IT ON THE 
TABLE AND LOOKED AT PRINCE ANDREW EVIDENTLY CONSIDERING 
SOMETHING
AH WHAT A CALAMITY YOU SAY THE AFFAIR WAS DECISIVE BUT 
MORTIER IS NOT CAPTURED AGAIN HE PONDERED I AM VERY GLAD 
YOU HAVE BROUGHT GOOD NEWS THOUGH SCHMIDTS DEATH IS A 
HEAVY PRICE TO PAY FOR THE VICTORY HIS MAJESTY WILL NO DOUBT 
WISH TO SEE YOU BUT NOT TODAY I THANK YOU YOU MUST HAVE 
A REST BE AT THE LEVEE TOMORROW AFTER THE PARADE HOWEVER 
I WILL LET YOU KNOW
THE STUPID SMILE WHICH HAD LEFT HIS FACE WHILE HE WAS 
SPEAKING REAPPEARED
AU REVOIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH HIS MAJESTY WILL PROB 
ABLY DESIRE TO SEE YOU HE ADDED BOWING HIS HEAD
WHEN PRINCE ANDREW LEFT THE PALACE HE FELT THAT ALL THE 
INTEREST AND HAPPINESS THE VICTORY HAD AFFORDED HIM HAD 
BEEN NOW LEFT IN THE INDIFFERENT HANDS OF THE MINISTER OF WAR 
AND THE POLITE ADJUTANT THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS THOUGHTS IN 
STANTANEOUSLY CHANGED THE BATTLE SEEMED THE MEMORY OF A 
REMOTE EVENT LONG PAST FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER X
PRINCE ANDREW STAYED AT BRUNN WITH BILIBIN A RUSSIAN 
ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS IN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE
AH MY DEAR PRINCE I COULD NOT HAVE A MORE WELCOME 
VISITOR SAID BILIBIN AS HE CAME OUT TO MEET PRINCE ANDREW 
FRANZ PUT THE PRINCES THINGS IN MY BEDROOM SAID HE TO 
THE SERVANT WHO WAS USHERING BOLKONSKI IN SO YOURE A 
MESSENGER OF VICTORY EH SPLENDID AND I AM SITTING HERE 
ILL AS YOU SEE
AFTER WASHING AND DRESSING PRINCE ANDREW CAME INTO 
THE DIPLOMATS LUXURIOUS STUDY AND SAT DOWN TO THE DINNER 
PREPARED FOR HIM BILIBIN SETTLED DOWN COMFORTABLY BESIDE 
THE FIRE
AFTER HIS JOURNEY AND THE CAMPAIGN DURING WHICH HE HAD 
BEEN DEPRIVED OF ALL THE COMFORTS OF CLEANLINESS AND ALL THE 
REFINEMENTS OF LIFE PRINCE ANDREW FELT A PLEASANT SENSE OF 
REPOSE AMONG LUXURIOUS SURROUNDINGS SUCH AS HE HAD BEEN 
ACCUSTOMED TO FROM CHILDHOOD BESIDES IT WAS PLEASANT AF 
TER HIS RECEPTION BY THE AUSTRIANS TO SPEAK IF NOT IN RUSSIAN 
FOR THEY WERE SPEAKING FRENCH AT LEAST WITH A RUSSIAN WHO 
WOULD HE SUPPOSED SHARE THE GENERAL RUSSIAN ANTIPATHY TO 
THE AUSTRIANS WHICH WAS THEN PARTICULARLY STRONG
BILIBIN WAS A MAN OF THIRTYFIVE A BACHELOR AND OF THE 
SAME CIRCLE AS PRINCE ANDREW THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTH 
ER PREVIOUSLY IN PETERSBURG BUT HAD BECOME MORE INTIMATE WAR AND PEACE WHEN PRINCE ANDREW WAS IN VIENNA WITH KUTUZOV JUST AS 
PRINCE ANDREW WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO GAVE PROMISE OF RISING 
HIGH IN THE MILITARY PROFESSION SO TO AN EVEN GREATER EXTENT 
BILIBIN GAVE PROMISE OF RISING IN HIS DIPLOMATIC CAREER HE 
STILL A YOUNG MAN BUT NO LONGER A YOUNG DIPLOMAT AS HE HAD 
ENTERED THE SERVICE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN HAD BEEN IN PARIS 
AND COPENHAGEN AND NOW HELD A RATHER IMPORTANT POST IN 
VIENNA BOTH THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND OUR AMBASSADOR IN 
VIENNA KNEW HIM AND VALUED HIM HE WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE 
MANY DIPLOMATS WHO ARE ESTEEMED BECAUSE THEY HAVE CER 
TAIN NEGATIVE QUALITIES AVOID DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND SPEAK 
FRENCH HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO LIKING WORK KNEW HOW 
TO DO IT AND DESPITE HIS INDOLENCE WOULD SOMETIMES SPEND 
A WHOLE NIGHT AT HIS WRITING TABLE HE WORKED WELL WHATEVER 
THE IMPORT OF HIS WORK IT WAS NOT THE QUESTION WHAT FOR 
BUT THE QUESTION HOW THAT INTERESTED HIM WHAT THE DIPLO 
MATIC MATTER MIGHT BE HE DID NOT CARE BUT IT GAVE HIM GREAT 
PLEASURE TO PREPARE A CIRCULAR MEMORANDUM OR REPORT SKILL 
FULLY POINTEDLY AND ELEGANTLY BILIBINS SERVICES WERE VALUED 
NOT ONLY FOR WHAT HE WROTE BUT ALSO FOR HIS SKILL IN DEALING 
AND CONVERSING WITH THOSE IN THE HIGHEST SPHERES
BILIBIN LIKED CONVERSATION AS HE LIKED WORK ONLY WHEN IT 
COULD BE MADE ELEGANTLY WITTY IN SOCIETY HE ALWAYS AWAITED 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SOMETHING STRIKING AND TOOK PART IN A 
CONVERSATION ONLY WHEN THAT WAS POSSIBLE HIS CONVERSATION 
WAS ALWAYS SPRINKLED WITH WITTILY ORIGINAL FINISHED PHRASES 
OF GENERAL INTEREST THESE SAYINGS WERE PREPARED IN THE INNER 
LABORATORY OF HIS MIND IN A PORTABLE FORM AS IF INTENTIONALLY 
SO THAT INSIGNIFICANT SOCIETY PEOPLE MIGHT CARRY THEM FROM  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMDRAWING ROOM TO DRAWING ROOM AND IN FACT BILIBINS WIT 
TICISMS WERE HAWKED ABOUT IN THE VIENNESE DRAWING ROOMS 
AND OFTEN HAD AN INFLUENCE ON MATTERS CONSIDERED IMPOR 
TANT
HIS THIN WORN SALLOW FACE WAS COVERED WITH DEEP WRIN 
KLES WHICH ALWAYS LOOKED AS CLEAN AND WELL WASHED AS THE 
TIPS OF ONES FINGERS AFTER A RUSSIAN BATH THE MOVEMENT OF 
THESE WRINKLES FORMED THE PRINCIPAL PLAY OF EXPRESSION ON 
HIS FACE NOW HIS FOREHEAD WOULD PUCKER INTO DEEP FOLDS AND 
HIS EYEBROWS WERE LIFTED THEN HIS EYEBROWS WOULD DESCEND 
AND DEEP WRINKLES WOULD CREASE HIS CHEEKS HIS SMALL DEEP
SET EYES ALWAYS TWINKLED AND LOOKED OUT STRAIGHT
WELL NOW TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPLOITS SAID HE
BOLKONSKI VERY MODESTLY WITHOUT ONCE MENTIONING HIM 
SELF DESCRIBED THE ENGAGEMENT AND HIS RECEPTION BY THE 
MINISTER OF WAR
THEY RECEIVED ME AND MY NEWS AS ONE RECEIVES A DOG IN A 
GAME OF SKITTLES SAID HE IN CONCLUSION
BILIBIN SMILED AND THE WRINKLES ON HIS FACE DISAPPEARED
CEPENDANT MON CHER HE REMARKED EXAMINING HIS NAILS 
FROM A DISTANCE AND PUCKERING THE SKIN ABOVE HIS LEFT EYE 
MALGRE LA HAUTE ESTIME QUE JE PROFESSE POUR THE ORTHODOX 
RUSSIAN ARMY JAVOUE QUE VOTRE VICTOIRE NEST PAS DES PLUS 
VICTORIEUSES
BUT MY DEAR FELLOW WITH ALL MY RESPECT FOR THE OR 
THODOX RUSSIAN ARMY I MUST SAY THAT YOUR VICTORY WAS NOT 
PARTICULARLY VICTORIOUS
HE WENT ON TALKING IN THIS WAY IN FRENCH UTTERING ONLY 
THOSE WORDS IN RUSSIAN ON WHICH HE WISHED TO PUT A CON WAR AND PEACE TEMPTUOUS EMPHASIS
COME NOW YOU WITH ALL YOUR FORCES FALL ON THE UNFOR 
TUNATE MORTIER AND HIS ONE DIVISION AND EVEN THEN MORTIER 
SLIPS THROUGH YOUR FINGERS WHERES THE VICTORY
BUT SERIOUSLY SAID PRINCE ANDREW WE CAN AT ANY RATE SAY 
WITHOUT BOASTING THAT IT WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN AT ULM
WHY DIDNT YOU CAPTURE ONE JUST ONE MARSHAL FOR US
BECAUSE NOT EVERYTHING HAPPENS AS ONE EXPECTS OR WITH 
THE SMOOTHNESS OF A PARADE WE HAD EXPECTED AS I TOLD YOU 
TO GET AT THEIR REAR BY SEVEN IN THE MORNING BUT HAD NOT 
REACHED IT BY FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON
AND WHY DIDNT YOU DO IT AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING YOU 
OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THERE AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING RETURNED 
BILIBIN WITH A SMILE YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THERE AT SEVEN 
IN THE MORNING
WHY DID YOU NOT SUCCEED IN IMPRESSING ON BONAPARTE BY 
DIPLOMATIC METHODS THAT HE HAD BETTER LEAVE GENOA ALONE 
RETORTED PRINCE ANDREW IN THE SAME TONE
I KNOW INTERRUPTED BILIBIN YOURE THINKING ITS VERY EASY 
TO TAKE MARSHALS SITTING ON A SOFA BY THE FIRE THAT IS TRUE BUT 
STILL WHY DIDNT YOU CAPTURE HIM SO DONT BE SURPRISED IF NOT 
ONLY THE MINISTER OF WAR BUT ALSO HIS MOST AUGUST MAJESTY 
THE EMPEROR AND KING FRANCIS IS NOT MUCH DELIGHTED BY YOUR 
VICTORY EVEN I A POOR SECRETARY OF THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY DO 
NOT FEEL ANY NEED IN TOKEN OF MY JOY TO GIVE MY FRANZ A THALER 
OR LET HIM GO WITH HIS LIEBCHEN TO THE PRATER TRUE WE HAVE 
NO PRATER HERE
HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AT PRINCE ANDREW AND SUDDENLY UN 
WRINKLED HIS FOREHEAD FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMIT IS NOW MY TURN TO ASK YOU WHY MON CHER SAID 
BOLKONSKI I CONFESS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND PERHAPS THERE ARE 
DIPLOMATIC SUBTLETIES HERE BEYOND MY FEEBLE INTELLIGENCE BUT 
I CANT MAKE IT OUT MACK LOSES A WHOLE ARMY THE ARCHDUKE 
FERDINAND AND THE ARCHDUKE KARL GIVE NO SIGNS OF LIFE AND 
MAKE BLUNDER AFTER BLUNDER KUTUZOV ALONE AT LAST GAINS A 
REAL VICTORY DESTROYING THE SPELL OF THE INVINCIBILITY OF THE 
FRENCH AND THE MINISTER OF WAR DOES NOT EVEN CARE TO HEAR 
THE DETAILS
THATS JUST IT MY DEAR FELLOW YOU SEE ITS HURRAH FOR THE 
TSAR FOR RUSSIA FOR THE ORTHODOX GREEK FAITH ALL THAT IS 
BEAUTIFUL BUT WHAT DO WE I MEAN THE AUSTRIAN COURT CARE 
FOR YOUR VICTORIES BRING US NICE NEWS OF A VICTORY BY THE 
ARCHDUKE KARL OR FERDINAND ONE ARCHDUKES AS GOOD AS AN 
OTHER AS YOU KNOW AND EVEN IF IT IS ONLY OVER A FIRE BRIGADE 
OF BONAPARTES THAT WILL BE ANOTHER STORY AND WELL FIRE OFF  
SOME CANNON BUT THIS SORT OF THING SEEMS DONE ON PURPOSE 
TO VEX US THE ARCHDUKE KARL DOES NOTHING THE ARCHDUKE 
FERDINAND DISGRACES HIMSELF YOU ABANDON VIENNA GIVE UP 
ITS DEFENSEAS MUCH AS TO SAY HEAVEN IS WITH US BUT HEAV 
EN HELP YOU AND YOUR CAPITAL THE ONE GENERAL WHOM WE ALL 
LOVED SCHMIDT YOU EXPOSE TO A BULLET AND THEN YOU CON 
GRATULATE US ON THE VICTORY ADMIT THAT MORE IRRITATING NEWS 
THAN YOURS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONCEIVED ITS AS IF IT HAD 
BEEN DONE ON PURPOSE ON PURPOSE BESIDES SUPPOSE YOU DID 
GAIN A BRILLIANT VICTORY IF EVEN THE ARCHDUKE KARL GAINED A 
VICTORY WHAT EFFECT WOULD THAT HAVE ON THE GENERAL COURSE 
OF EVENTS ITS TOO LATE NOW WHEN VIENNA IS OCCUPIED BY THE 
FRENCH ARMYWAR AND PEACE WHAT OCCUPIED VIENNA OCCUPIED
NOT ONLY OCCUPIED BUT BONAPARTE IS AT SCHONBRUNN AND 
THE COUNT OUR DEAR COUNT VRBNA GOES TO HIM FOR ORDERS
AFTER THE FATIGUES AND IMPRESSIONS OF THE JOURNEY HIS RE 
CEPTION AND ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING DINED BOLKONSKI FELT 
THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE IN THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORDS 
HE HEARD
COUNT LICHTENFELS WAS HERE THIS MORNING BILIBIN CON 
TINUED AND SHOWED ME A LETTER IN WHICH THE PARADE OF THE 
FRENCH IN VIENNA WAS FULLY DESCRIBED PRINCE MURAT ET TOUT 
LE TREMBLEMENT YOU SEE THAT YOUR VICTORY IS NOT A MATTER FOR 
GREAT REJOICING AND THAT YOU CANT BE RECEIVED AS A SAVIOR
REALLY I DONT CARE ABOUT THAT I DONT CARE AT ALL SAID 
PRINCE ANDREW BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS NEWS OF 
THE BATTLE BEFORE KREMS WAS REALLY OF SMALL IMPORTANCE IN 
VIEW OF SUCH EVENTS AS THE FALL OF AUSTRIAS CAPITAL HOW IS 
IT VIENNA WAS TAKEN WHAT OF THE BRIDGE AND ITS CELEBRATED 
BRIDGEHEAD AND PRINCE AUERSPERG WE HEARD REPORTS THAT 
PRINCE AUERSPERG WAS DEFENDING VIENNA HE SAID
PRINCE AUERSPERG IS ON THIS ON OUR SIDE OF THE RIVER AND 
IS DEFENDING USDOING IT VERY BADLY I THINK BUT STILL HE IS DE 
FENDING US BUT VIENNA IS ON THE OTHER SIDE NO THE BRIDGE 
HAS NOT YET BEEN TAKEN AND I HOPE IT WILL NOT BE FOR IT IS 
MINED AND ORDERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO BLOW IT UP OTHERWISE 
WE SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE BEEN IN THE MOUNTAINS OF BOHEMIA 
AND YOU AND YOUR ARMY WOULD HAVE SPENT A BAD QUARTER OF AN 
HOUR BETWEEN TWO FIRES
BUT STILL THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER 
SAID PRINCE ANDREW FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWELL I THINK IT IS THE BIGWIGS HERE THINK SO TOO BUT 
THEY DARENT SAY SO IT WILL BE AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THE CAMPAIGN IT WONT BE YOUR SKIRMISHING AT DURRENSTEIN 
OR GUNPOWDER AT ALL THAT WILL DECIDE THE MATTER BUT THOSE 
WHO DEVISED IT SAID BILIBIN QUOTING ONE OF HIS OWN MOTS RE 
LEASING THE WRINKLES ON HIS FOREHEAD AND PAUSING THE ONLY 
QUESTION IS WHAT WILL COME OF THE MEETING BETWEEN THE EM 
PEROR ALEXANDER AND THE KING OF PRUSSIA IN BERLIN IF PRUSSIA 
JOINS THE ALLIES AUSTRIAS HAND WILL BE FORCED AND THERE WILL 
BE WAR IF NOT IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF SETTLING WHERE THE PRE 
LIMINARIES OF THE NEW CAMPO FORMIO ARE TO BE DRAWN UP
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS PRINCE ANDREW SUDDEN 
LY EXCLAIMED CLENCHING HIS SMALL HAND AND STRIKING THE TABLE 
WITH IT AND WHAT LUCK THE MAN HAS
BUONAPARTE SAID BILIBIN INQUIRINGLY PUCKERING UP HIS 
FOREHEAD TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING WIT 
TY BUONAPARTE HE REPEATED ACCENTUATING THE U I THINK 
HOWEVER NOW THAT HE LAYS DOWN LAWS FOR AUSTRIA AT SCHONB 
RUNN IL FAUT LUI FAIRE GRACE DE LU I SHALL CERTAINLY ADOPT AN 
INNOVATION AND CALL HIM SIMPLY BONAPARTE
WE MUST LET HIM OFF THE U
BUT JOKING APART SAID PRINCE ANDREW DO YOU REALLY 
THINK THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER
THIS IS WHAT I THINK AUSTRIA HAS BEEN MADE A FOOL OF 
AND SHE IS NOT USED TO IT SHE WILL RETALIATE AND SHE HAS 
BEEN FOOLED IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE HER PROVINCES HAVE 
BEEN PILLAGEDTHEY SAY THE HOLY RUSSIAN ARMY LOOTS TERRIBLY 
HER ARMY IS DESTROYED HER CAPITAL TAKEN AND ALL THIS FOR THE 
BEAUX YEUX OF HIS SARDINIAN MAJESTY AND THEREFORETHIS IS WAR AND PEACE BETWEEN OURSELVESI INSTINCTIVELY FEEL THAT WE ARE BEING DE 
CEIVED MY INSTINCT TELLS ME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH FRANCE AND 
PROJECTS FOR PEACE A SECRET PEACE CONCLUDED SEPARATELY
FINE EYES
IMPOSSIBLE CRIED PRINCE ANDREW THAT WOULD BE TOO 
BASE
IF WE LIVE WE SHALL SEE REPLIED BILIBIN HIS FACE AGAIN BE 
COMING SMOOTH AS A SIGN THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS AT AN 
END
WHEN PRINCE ANDREW REACHED THE ROOM PREPARED FOR 
HIM AND LAY DOWN IN A CLEAN SHIRT ON THE FEATHER BED WITH ITS 
WARMED AND FRAGRANT PILLOWS HE FELT THAT THE BATTLE OF WHICH 
HE HAD BROUGHT TIDINGS WAS FAR FAR AWAY FROM HIM THE AL 
LIANCE WITH PRUSSIA AUSTRIAS TREACHERY BONAPARTES NEW 
TRIUMPH TOMORROWS LEVEE AND PARADE AND THE AUDIENCE 
WITH THE EMPEROR FRANCIS OCCUPIED HIS THOUGHTS
HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND IMMEDIATELY A SOUND OF CANNONAD 
ING OF MUSKETRY AND THE RATTLING OF CARRIAGE WHEELS SEEMED 
TO FILL HIS EARS AND NOW AGAIN DRAWN OUT IN A THIN LINE THE 
MUSKETEERS WERE DESCENDING THE HILL THE FRENCH WERE FIRING 
AND HE FELT HIS HEART PALPITATING AS HE RODE FORWARD BESIDE 
SCHMIDT WITH THE BULLETS MERRILY WHISTLING ALL AROUND AND 
HE EXPERIENCED TENFOLD THE JOY OF LIVING AS HE HAD NOT DONE 
SINCE CHILDHOOD
HE WOKE UP
YES THAT ALL HAPPENED HE SAID AND SMILING HAPPILY TO 
HIMSELF LIKE A CHILD HE FELL INTO A DEEP YOUTHFUL SLUMBER FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER XI
NEXT DAY HE WOKE LATE RECALLING HIS RECENT IMPRESSIONS 
THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT CAME INTO HIS MIND WAS THAT TODAY 
HE HAD TO BE PRESENTED TO THE EMPEROR FRANCIS HE REMEM 
BERED THE MINISTER OF WAR THE POLITE AUSTRIAN ADJUTANT 
BILIBIN AND LAST NIGHTS CONVERSATION HAVING DRESSED FOR 
HIS ATTENDANCE AT COURT IN FULL PARADE UNIFORM WHICH HE 
HAD NOT WORN FOR A LONG TIME HE WENT INTO BILIBINS STUDY 
FRESH ANIMATED AND HANDSOME WITH HIS HAND BANDAGED 
IN THE STUDY WERE FOUR GENTLEMEN OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
WITH PRINCE HIPPOLYTE KURAGIN WHO WAS A SECRETARY TO THE 
EMBASSY BOLKONSKI WAS ALREADY ACQUAINTED BILIBIN INTRO 
DUCED HIM TO THE OTHERS
THE GENTLEMEN ASSEMBLED AT BILIBINS WERE YOUNG 
WEALTHY GAY SOCIETY MEN WHO HERE AS IN VIENNA FORMED A 
SPECIAL SET WHICH BILIBIN THEIR LEADER CALLED LES NOTRES THIS 
SET CONSISTING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OF DIPLOMATS EVIDENTLY 
HAD ITS OWN INTERESTS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WAR OR 
POLITICS BUT RELATED TO HIGH SOCIETY TO CERTAIN WOMEN AND 
TO THE OFFICIAL SIDE OF THE SERVICE THESE GENTLEMEN RECEIVED 
PRINCE ANDREW AS ONE OF THEMSELVES AN HONOR THEY DID NOT 
EXTEND TO MANY FROM POLITENESS AND TO START CONVERSATION 
THEY ASKED HIM A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ARMY AND THE BAT 
TLE AND THEN THE TALK WENT OFF INTO MERRY JESTS AND GOSSIP
OURSWAR AND PEACE BUT THE BEST OF IT WAS SAID ONE TELLING OF THE MISFORTUNE 
OF A FELLOW DIPLOMAT THAT THE CHANCELLOR TOLD HIM FLATLY THAT 
HIS APPOINTMENT TO LONDON WAS A PROMOTION AND THAT HE 
WAS SO TO REGARD IT CAN YOU FANCY THE FIGURE HE CUT
BUT THE WORST OF IT GENTLEMENI AM GIVING KURAGIN AWAY 
TO YOUIS THAT THAT MAN SUFFERS AND THIS DON JUAN WICKED 
FELLOW IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT
PRINCE HIPPOLYTE WAS LOLLING IN A LOUNGE CHAIR WITH HIS 
LEGS OVER ITS ARM HE BEGAN TO LAUGH
TELL ME ABOUT THAT HE SAID
OH YOU DON JUAN YOU SERPENT CRIED SEVERAL VOICES
YOU BOLKONSKI DONT KNOW SAID BILIBIN TURNING TO 
PRINCE ANDREW THAT ALL THE ATROCITIES OF THE FRENCH ARMY I 
NEARLY SAID OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO

PRINCE HIPPOLYTE AND BEGAN LOOKING THROUGH A LORGNETTE 
AT HIS ELEVATED LEGS

WIFES ACCOUNT WAS THE BUTT OF THIS SET
OH I MUST GIVE YOU A TREAT BILIBIN WHISPERED TO BOLKON 
SKI KURAGIN IS EXQUISITE WHEN HE DISCUSSES POLITICSYOU

HEAD BEGAN TALKING TO HIM ABOUT POLITICS PRINCE ANDREW 
AND THE OTHERS GATHERED ROUND THESE TWO FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMTHE BERLIN CABINET CANNOT EXPRESS A FEELING OF ALLIANCE 
BEGAN HIPPOLYTE GAZING ROUND WITH IMPORTANCE AT THE 
OTHERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING AS IN ITS LAST NOTE YOU UNDER 
STAND BESIDES UNLESS HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR DEROGATES 
FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF OUR ALLIANCE
WAIT I HAVE NOT FINISHED HE SAID TO PRINCE ANDREW 
SEIZING HIM BY THE ARM I BELIEVE THAT INTERVENTION WILL BE 
STRONGER THAN NONINTERVENTION AND HE PAUSED FINALLY 
ONE CANNOT IMPUTE THE NONRECEIPT OF OUR DISPATCH OF NOVEM 
BER  THAT IS HOW IT WILL END AND HE RELEASED BOLKONSKIS 
ARM TO INDICATE THAT HE HAD NOW QUITE FINISHED
DEMOSTHENES I KNOW THEE BY THE PEBBLE THOU SECRETEST 
IN THY GOLDEN MOUTH SAID BILIBIN AND THE MOP OF HAIR ON 
HIS HEAD MOVED WITH SATISFACTION
EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND HIPPOLYTE LOUDER THAN ANYONE 
HE WAS EVIDENTLY DISTRESSED AND BREATHED PAINFULLY BUT 
COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE WILD LAUGHTER THAT CONVULSED HIS USU 
ALLY IMPASSIVE FEATURES
WELL NOW GENTLEMEN SAID BILIBIN BOLKONSKI IS MY 
GUEST IN THIS HOUSE AND IN BRUNN ITSELF I WANT TO ENTERTAIN

FACTS I CANT REPLIED BOLKONSKI SMILING
WELL TALK AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ANYWAY HE HAS A PASSION 
FOR GIVING AUDIENCES BUT HE DOES NOT LIKE TALKING HIMSELF 
AND CANT DO IT AS YOU WILL SEE FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER XII
AT THE LEVEE PRINCE ANDREW STOOD AMONG THE AUSTRIAN OF 
FICERS AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO AND THE EMPEROR FRANCIS MERELY 
LOOKED FIXEDLY INTO HIS FACE AND JUST NODDED TO HIM WITH TO 
HIM WITH HIS LONG HEAD BUT AFTER IT WAS OVER THE ADJUTANT HE 
HAD SEEN THE PREVIOUS DAY CEREMONIOUSLY INFORMED BOLKON 
SKI THAT THE EMPEROR DESIRED TO GIVE HIM AN AUDIENCE THE 
EMPEROR FRANCIS RECEIVED HIM STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
ROOM BEFORE THE CONVERSATION BEGAN PRINCE ANDREW WAS 
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THE EMPEROR SEEMED CONFUSED AND 
BLUSHED AS IF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY
TELL ME WHEN DID THE BATTLE BEGIN HE ASKED HURRIEDLY
PRINCE ANDREW REPLIED THEN FOLLOWED OTHER QUESTIONS 
JUST AS SIMPLE WAS KUTUZOV WELL WHEN HAD HE LEFT KREMS 
AND SO ON THE EMPEROR SPOKE AS IF HIS SOLE AIM WERE TO PUT 
A GIVEN NUMBER OF QUESTIONSTHE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS 
AS WAS ONLY TOO EVIDENT DID NOT INTEREST HIM
AT WHAT OCLOCK DID THE BATTLE BEGIN ASKED THE EMPER 
OR
I CANNOT INFORM YOUR MAJESTY AT WHAT OCLOCK THE BAT 
TLE BEGAN AT THE FRONT BUT AT DURRENSTEIN WHERE I WAS OUR 
ATTACK BEGAN AFTER FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON REPLIED BOLKONSKI 
GROWING MORE ANIMATED AND EXPECTING THAT HE WOULD HAVE A 
CHANCE TO GIVE A RELIABLE ACCOUNT WHICH HE HAD READY IN HIS 
MIND OF ALL HE KNEW AND HAD SEEN BUT THE EMPEROR SMILED WAR AND PEACE AND INTERRUPTED HIM
HOW MANY MILES
FROM WHERE TO WHERE YOUR MAJESTY
FROM DURRENSTEIN TO KREMS
THREE AND A HALF MILES YOUR MAJESTY
THE FRENCH HAVE ABANDONED THE LEFT BANK
ACCORDING TO THE SCOUTS THE LAST OF THEM CROSSED ON RAFTS 
DURING THE NIGHT
IS THERE SUFFICIENT FORAGE IN KREMS
FORAGE HAS NOT BEEN SUPPLIED TO THE EXTENT
THE EMPEROR INTERRUPTED HIM
AT WHAT OCLOCK WAS GENERAL SCHMIDT KILLED
AT SEVEN OCLOCK I BELIEVE
AT SEVEN OCLOCK ITS VERY SAD VERY SAD
THE EMPEROR THANKED PRINCE ANDREW AND BOWED PRINCE 
ANDREW WITHDREW AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY 
COURTIERS ON ALL SIDES EVERYWHERE HE SAW FRIENDLY LOOKS AND 
HEARD FRIENDLY WORDS YESTERDAYS ADJUTANT REPROACHED HIM 
FOR NOT HAVING STAYED AT THE PALACE AND OFFERED HIM HIS OWN 
HOUSE THE MINISTER OF WAR CAME UP AND CONGRATULATED HIM 
ON THE MARIA THERESA ORDER OF THE THIRD GRADE WHICH THE 
EMPEROR WAS CONFERRING ON HIM THE EMPRESS CHAMBER 
LAIN INVITED HIM TO SEE HER MAJESTY THE ARCHDUCHESS ALSO 
WISHED TO SEE HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHOM TO ANSWER AND 
FOR A FEW SECONDS COLLECTED HIS THOUGHTS THEN THE RUSSIAN 
AMBASSADOR TOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDER LED HIM TO THE WIN 
DOW AND BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM
CONTRARY TO BILIBINS FORECAST THE NEWS HE HAD BROUGHT 
WAS JOYFULLY RECEIVED A THANKSGIVING SERVICE WAS ARRANGED  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMKUTUZOV WAS AWARDED THE GRAND CROSS OF MARIA THERESA 
AND THE WHOLE ARMY RECEIVED REWARDS BOLKONSKI WAS INVIT 
ED EVERYWHERE AND HAD TO SPEND THE WHOLE MORNING CALLING 
ON THE PRINCIPAL AUSTRIAN DIGNITARIES BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE 
IN THE AFTERNOON HAVING MADE ALL HIS CALLS HE WAS RETURNING 
TO BILIBINS HOUSE THINKING OUT A LETTER TO HIS FATHER ABOUT 
THE BATTLE AND HIS VISIT TO BRUNN AT THE DOOR HE FOUND A VE 
HICLE HALF FULL OF LUGGAGE FRANZ BILIBINS MAN WAS DRAGGING 
A PORTMANTEAU WITH SOME DIFFICULTY OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR
BEFORE RETURNING TO BILIBINS PRINCE ANDREW HAD GONE TO 
BOOKSHOP TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH SOME BOOKS FOR THE CAM 
PAIGN AND HAD SPENT SOME TIME IN THE SHOP
WHAT IS IT HE ASKED
OH YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID FRANZ WITH DIFFICULTY ROLLING 
THE PORTMANTEAU INTO THE VEHICLE WE ARE TO MOVE ON STILL 
FARTHER THE SCOUNDREL IS AGAIN AT OUR HEELS
EH WHAT ASKED PRINCE ANDREW
BILIBIN CAME OUT TO MEET HIM HIS USUALLY CALM FACE 
SHOWED EXCITEMENT
THERE NOW CONFESS THAT THIS IS DELIGHTFUL SAID HE THIS 
AFFAIR OF THE THABOR BRIDGE AT VIENNA THEY HAVE CROSSED 
WITHOUT STRIKING A BLOW
PRINCE ANDREW COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
BUT WHERE DO YOU COME FROM NOT TO KNOW WHAT EVERY 
COACHMAN IN THE TOWN KNOWS
I COME FROM THE ARCHDUCHESS I HEARD NOTHING THERE
AND YOU DIDNT SEE THAT EVERYBODY IS PACKING UP
I DID NOT WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT INQUIRED PRINCE ANDREW 
IMPATIENTLYWAR AND PEACE WHATS IT ALL ABOUT WHY THE FRENCH HAVE CROSSED THE 
BRIDGE THAT AUERSPERG WAS DEFENDING AND THE BRIDGE WAS 
NOT BLOWN UP SO MURAT IS NOW RUSHING ALONG THE ROAD TO 
BRUNN AND WILL BE HERE IN A DAY OR TWO
WHAT HERE BUT WHY DID THEY NOT BLOW UP THE BRIDGE 
IF IT WAS MINED
THAT IS WHAT I ASK YOU NO ONE NOT EVEN BONAPARTE 
KNOWS WHY
BOLKONSKI SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
BUT IF THE BRIDGE IS CROSSED IT MEANS THAT THE ARMY TOO IS 
LOST IT WILL BE CUT OFF SAID HE
THATS JUST IT ANSWERED BILIBIN LISTEN THE FRENCH 
ENTERED VIENNA AS I TOLD YOU VERY WELL NEXT DAY WHICH 
WAS YESTERDAY THOSE GENTLEMEN MESSIEURS LES MARECHAUX 
MURAT LANNESAND BELLIARD MOUNT AND RIDE TO BRIDGE OB 
SERVE THAT ALL THREE ARE GASCONS GENTLEMEN SAYS ONE OF 
THEM YOU KNOW THE THABOR BRIDGE IS MINED AND DOUBLY 
MINED AND THAT THERE ARE MENACING FORTIFICATIONS AT ITS HEAD 
AND AN ARMY OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN HAS BEEN ORDERED TO 
BLOW UP THE BRIDGE AND NOT LET US CROSS BUT IT WILL PLEASE 
OUR SOVEREIGN THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON IF WE TAKE THIS BRIDGE 
SO LET US THREE GO AND TAKE IT YES LETS SAY THE OTHERS AND 
OFF THEY GO AND TAKE THE BRIDGE CROSS IT AND NOW WITH THEIR 
WHOLE ARMY ARE ON THIS SIDE OF THE DANUBE MARCHING ON US 
YOU AND YOUR LINES OF COMMUNICATION
THE MARSHALLS
STOP JESTING SAID PRINCE ANDREW SADLY AND SERIOUSLY 
THIS NEWS GRIEVED HIM AND YET HE WAS PLEASED
AS SOON AS HE LEARNED THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY WAS IN SUCH  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMA HOPELESS SITUATION IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT WAS HE WHO 
WAS DESTINED TO LEAD IT OUT OF THIS POSITION THAT HERE WAS 
THE TOULON THAT WOULD LIFT HIM FROM THE RANKS OF OBSCURE 
OFFICERS AND OFFER HIM THE FIRST STEP TO FAME LISTENING TO BIL 
IBIN HE WAS ALREADY IMAGINING HOW ON REACHING THE ARMY 
HE WOULD GIVE AN OPINION AT THE WAR COUNCIL WHICH WOULD 
BE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD SAVE THE ARMY AND HOW HE ALONE 
WOULD BE ENTRUSTED WITH THE EXECUTING OF THE PLAN
STOP THIS JESTING HE SAID
I AM NOT JESTING BILIBIN WENT ON NOTHING IS TRUER OR 
SADDER THESE GENTLEMEN RIDE ONTO THE BRIDGE ALONE AND 
WAVE WHITE HANDKERCHIEFS THEY ASSURE THE OFFICER ON DUTY 
THAT THEY THE MARSHALS ARE ON THEIR WAY TO NEGOTIATE WITH 
PRINCE AUERSPERG HE LETS THEM ENTER THE TETEDEPONT 
THEY SPIN HIM A THOUSAND GASCONADES SAYING THAT THE WAR 
IS OVER THAT THE EMPEROR FRANCIS IS ARRANGING A MEETING 
WITH BONAPARTE THAT THEY DESIRE TO SEE PRINCE AUERSPERG 
AND SO ON THE OFFICER SENDS FOR AUERSPERG THESE GENTLEMEN 
EMBRACE THE OFFICERS CRACK JOKES SIT ON THE CANNON AND 
MEANWHILE A FRENCH BATTALION GETS TO THE BRIDGE UNOBSERVED 
FLINGS THE BAGS OF INCENDIARY MATERIAL INTO THE WATER AND AP 
PROACHES THE TETEDEPONT AT LENGTH APPEARS THE LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL OUR DEAR PRINCE AUERSPERG VON MAUTERN HIMSELF 
DEAREST FOE FLOWER OF THE AUSTRIAN ARMY HERO OF THE TURK 
ISH WARS HOSTILITIES ARE ENDED WE CAN SHAKE ONE ANOTHERS 
HAND THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON BURNS WITH IMPATIENCE TO 
MAKE PRINCE AUERSPERGS ACQUAINTANCE IN A WORD THOSE 
GENTLEMEN GASCONS INDEED SO BEWILDERED HIM WITH FINE 
WORDS AND HE IS SO FLATTERED BY HIS RAPIDLY ESTABLISHED INTI WAR AND PEACE MACY WITH THE FRENCH MARSHALS AND SO DAZZLED BY THE SIGHT 
OF MURATS MANTLE AND OSTRICH PLUMES QUIL NY VOIT QUE DU 
FEU ET OUBLIE CELUI QUIL DEVAIT FAIRE FAIRE SUR LENNEMI 
IN SPITE OF THE ANIMATION OF HIS SPEECH BILIBIN DID NOT FORGET 
TO PAUSE AFTER THIS MOT TO GIVE TIME FOR ITS DUE APPRECIATION 
THE FRENCH BATTALION RUSHES TO THE BRIDGEHEAD SPIKES THE 
GUNS AND THE BRIDGE IS TAKEN BUT WHAT IS BEST OF ALL HE WENT 
ON HIS EXCITEMENT SUBSIDING UNDER THE DELIGHTFUL INTEREST 
OF HIS OWN STORY IS THAT THE SERGEANT IN CHARGE OF THE CAN

DON THE ROAD CONNECTING HIM WITH THE TROOPS ARRIVING FROM 
RUSSIA HE WOULD HAVE TO MARCH WITH NO ROAD INTO UNKNOWN 
PARTS OF THE BOHEMIAN MOUNTAINS DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST

SUCH AS THAT OF ULM OR TO UTTER DESTRUCTION BUT TO FORESTALL 
THE FRENCH WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE ROAD 
FOR THE FRENCH FROM VIENNA TO ZNAIM WAS SHORTER AND BET 
TER THAN THE ROAD FOR THE RUSSIANS FROM KREMS TO ZNAIM
THE NIGHT HE RECEIVED THE NEWS KUTUZOV SENT BAGRATIONS 
VANGUARD FOUR THOUSAND STRONG TO THE RIGHT ACROSS THE HILLS 
FROM THE KREMSZNAIM TO THE VIENNAZNAIM ROAD BAGRA 
TION WAS TO MAKE THIS MARCH WITHOUT RESTING AND TO HALT

MUSKETS EXPLODE THE AMMUNITION AND ALL RETURN HOME AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
BUT THE GUNS REMAINED LOADED THE LOOPHOLES IN BLOCK 
HOUSES AND ENTRENCHMENTS LOOKED OUT JUST AS MENACINGLY 
AND THE UNLIMBERED CANNON CONFRONTED ONE ANOTHER AS BE 
FOREWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER XVI
HAVING RIDDEN ROUND THE WHOLE LINE FROM RIGHT FLANK TO 
LEFT PRINCE ANDREW MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE BATTERY FROM 
WHICH THE STAFF OFFICER HAD TOLD HIM THE WHOLE FIELD COULD BE 
SEEN HERE HE DISMOUNTED AND STOPPED BESIDE THE FARTHEST 
OF THE FOUR UNLIMBERED CANNON BEFORE THE GUNS AN ARTILLERY 
SENTRY WAS PACING UP AND DOWN HE STOOD AT ATTENTION WHEN 
THE OFFICER ARRIVED BUT AT A SIGN RESUMED HIS MEASURED MO 
NOTONOUS PACING BEHIND THE GUNS WERE THEIR LIMBERS AND 
STILL FARTHER BACK PICKET ROPES AND ARTILLERYMENS BONFIRES 
TO THE LEFT NOT FAR FROM THE FARTHEST CANNON WAS A SMALL 
NEWLY CONSTRUCTED WATTLE SHED FROM WHICH CAME THE SOUND 
OF OFFICERS VOICES IN EAGER CONVERSATION
IT WAS TRUE THAT A VIEW OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE RUSSIAN PO 
SITION AND THE GREATER PART OF THE ENEMYS OPENED OUT FROM 
THIS BATTERY JUST FACING IT ON THE CREST OF THE OPPOSITE HILL 
THE VILLAGE OF SCHON GRABERN COULD BE SEEN AND IN THREE 
PLACES TO LEFT AND RIGHT THE FRENCH TROOPS AMID THE SMOKE 
OF THEIR CAMPFIRES THE GREATER PART OF WHOM WERE EVIDENTLY 
IN THE VILLAGE ITSELF AND BEHIND THE HILL TO THE LEFT FROM THAT 
VILLAGE AMID THE SMOKE WAS SOMETHING RESEMBLING A BAT 
TERY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE IT CLEARLY WITH THE NAKED 
EYE OUR RIGHT FLANK WAS POSTED ON A RATHER STEEP INCLINE 
WHICH DOMINATED THE FRENCH POSITION OUR INFANTRY WERE 
STATIONED THERE AND AT THE FARTHEST POINT THE DRAGOONS IN  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMTHE CENTER WHERE TUSHINS BATTERY STOOD AND FROM WHICH 
PRINCE ANDREW WAS SURVEYING THE POSITION WAS THE EASIEST 
AND MOST DIRECT DESCENT AND ASCENT TO THE BROOK SEPARATING 
US FROM SCHON GRABERN ON THE LEFT OUR TROOPS WERE CLOSE TO 
A COPSE IN WHICH SMOKED THE BONFIRES OF OUR INFANTRY WHO 
WERE FELLING WOOD THE FRENCH LINE WAS WIDER THAN OURS AND 
IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY COULD EASILY OUTFLANK US ON BOTH SIDES 
BEHIND OUR POSITION WAS A STEEP AND DEEP DIP MAKING IT 
DIFFICULT FOR ARTILLERY AND CAVALRY TO RETIRE PRINCE ANDREW 
TOOK OUT HIS NOTEBOOK AND LEANING ON THE CANNON SKETCHED 
A PLAN OF THE POSITION HE MADE SOME NOTES ON TWO POINTS 
INTENDING TO MENTION THEM TO BAGRATION HIS IDEA WAS FIRST 
TO CONCENTRATE ALL THE ARTILLERY IN THE CENTER AND SECONDLY 
TO WITHDRAW THE CAVALRY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DIP PRINCE 
ANDREW BEING ALWAYS NEAR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF CLOSELY 
FOLLOWING THE MASS MOVEMENTS AND GENERAL ORDERS AND CON 
STANTLY STUDYING HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF BATTLES INVOLUNTARILY 
PICTURED TO HIMSELF THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN THE FORTHCOM 
ING ACTION IN BROAD OUTLINE HE IMAGINED ONLY IMPORTANT 
POSSIBILITIES IF THE ENEMY ATTACKS THE RIGHT FLANK HE SAID 
TO HIMSELF THE KIEV GRENADIERS AND THE PODOLSK CHASSEURS 
MUST HOLD THEIR POSITION TILL RESERVES FROM THE CENTER COME 
UP IN THAT CASE THE DRAGOONS COULD SUCCESSFULLY MAKE A 
FLANK COUNTERATTACK IF THEY ATTACK OUR CENTER WE HAVING THE 
CENTER BATTERY ON THIS HIGH GROUND SHALL WITHDRAW THE LEFT  
FLANK UNDER ITS COVER AND RETREAT TO THE DIP BY ECHELONS 
SO HE REASONED ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN BESIDE THE GUN 
HE HAD HEARD THE VOICES OF THE OFFICERS DISTINCTLY BUT AS OF 
TEN HAPPENS HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD A WORD OF WHAT THEY WERE WAR AND PEACE SAYING SUDDENLY HOWEVER HE WAS STRUCK BY A VOICE COMING 
FROM THE SHED AND ITS TONE WAS SO SINCERE THAT HE COULD NOT 
BUT LISTEN
NO FRIEND SAID A PLEASANT AND AS IT SEEMED TO PRINCE 
ANDREW A FAMILIAR VOICE WHAT I SAY IS THAT IF IT WERE POS 
SIBLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEYOND DEATH NONE OF US WOULD BE 
AFRAID OF IT THATS SO FRIEND
ANOTHER A YOUNGER VOICE INTERRUPTED HIM AFRAID OR 
NOT YOU CANT ESCAPE IT ANYHOW
ALL THE SAME ONE IS AFRAID OH YOU CLEVER PEOPLE SAID 
A THIRD MANLY VOICE INTERRUPTING THEM BOTH OF COURSE YOU 
ARTILLERY MEN ARE VERY WISE BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE EVERY 
THING ALONG WITH YOUVODKA AND SNACKS
AND THE OWNER OF THE MANLY VOICE EVIDENTLY AN INFANTRY 
OFFICER LAUGHED
YES ONE IS AFRAID CONTINUED THE FIRST SPEAKER HE OF THE 
FAMILIAR VOICE ONE IS AFRAID OF THE UNKNOWN THATS WHAT IT 
IS WHATEVER WE MAY SAY ABOUT THE SOUL GOING TO THE SKY WE 
KNOW THERE IS NO SKY BUT ONLY AN ATMOSPHERE
THE MANLY VOICE AGAIN INTERRUPTED THE ARTILLERY OFFICER
WELL STAND US SOME OF YOUR HERB VODKA TUSHIN IT 
SAID
WHY THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW THATS THE CAPTAIN WHO 
STOOD UP IN THE SUTLERS HUT WITHOUT HIS BOOTS HE RECOG 
NIZED THE AGREEABLE PHILOSOPHIZING VOICE WITH PLEASURE

SAW THAT THE HITHERTO MOTIONLESS MASSES OF THE FRENCH NOW 
SWAYED AND THAT THERE REALLY WAS A BATTERY TO THEIR LEFT THE

THE GENERAL HAD A FIT OF COUGHING AS A RESULT OF SHOUTING

AS POSSIBLE WHEN THE SUPPORTS ATTACHED TO TUSHINS BATTERY 
HAD BEEN MOVED AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACTION BY SOME

NOT CAPTURED BY THE FRENCH BECAUSE THE ENEMY COULD NOT 
SURMISE THAT ANYONE COULD HAVE THE EFFRONTERY TO CONTINUE 
FIRING FROM FOUR QUITE UNDEFENDED GUNS ON THE CONTRARY 
THE ENERGETIC ACTION OF THAT BATTERY LED THE FRENCH TO SUPPOSE 
THAT HEREIN THE CENTERTHE MAIN RUSSIAN FORCES WERE CONCEN

FLAKES OF FALLING SNOW WERE FLUTTERING IN THAT LIGHT TUSHIN 
HAD NOT RETURNED THE DOCTOR HAD NOT COME HE WAS ALONE 
NOW EXCEPT FOR A SOLDIER WHO WAS SITTING NAKED AT THE OTHER

GAVE A GRUNT AND ADDED WHAT A LOT OF MEN HAVE BEEN CRIP

PRINCE VASILI WAS NOT A MAN WHO DELIBERATELY THOUGHT OUT 
HIS PLANS STILL LESS DID HE THINK OF INJURING ANYONE FOR HIS

GOT ON AND TO WHOM GETTING ON HAD BECOME A HABIT SCHEMES 
AND DEVICES FOR WHICH HE NEVER RIGHTLY ACCOUNTED TO HIMSELF 
BUT WHICH FORMED THE WHOLE INTEREST OF HIS LIFE WERE CON 
STANTLY SHAPING THEMSELVES IN HIS MIND ARISING FROM THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND PERSONS HE MET OF THESE PLANS HE HAD 
NOT MERELY ONE OR TWO IN HIS HEAD BUT DOZENS SOME ONLY 
BEGINNING TO FORM THEMSELVES SOME APPROACHING ACHIEVE 
MENT AND SOME IN COURSE OF DISINTEGRATION HE DID NOT FOR

GAIN HIS CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP AND THROUGH HIM OBTAIN 
A SPECIAL GRANT NOR DID HE SAY TO HIMSELF PIERRE IS A RICH 
MAN I MUST ENTICE HIM TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER AND LEND ME 
THE FORTY THOUSAND RUBLES I NEED BUT WHEN HE CAME ACROSS

HIM THAT THIS MAN COULD BE USEFUL AND WITHOUT ANY PRE 
MEDITATION PRINCE VASILI TOOK THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN 
HIS CONFIDENCE FLATTER HIM BECOME INTIMATE WITH HIM AND 
FINALLY MAKE HIS REQUEST
HE HAD PIERRE AT HAND IN MOSCOW AND PROCURED FOR HIM

THE POOR PRINCESS THAT IT MIGHT NOT OCCUR TO HER TO SPEAK OF 
HIS SHARE IN THE AFFAIR OF THE INLAID PORTFOLIO PIERRE SIGNED

YOUNGER SISTERS ALSO BECAME AFFECTIONATE TO HIM ESPECIALLY 
THE YOUNGEST THE PRETTY ONE WITH THE MOLE WHO OFTEN MADE 
HIM FEEL CONFUSED BY HER SMILES AND HER OWN CONFUSION 
WHEN MEETING HIMWAR AND PEACE IT SEEMED SO NATURAL TO PIERRE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD LIKE 
HIM AND IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED SO UNNATURAL HAD ANYONE 
DISLIKED HIM THAT HE COULD NOT BUT BELIEVE IN THE SINCERITY 
OF THOSE AROUND HIM BESIDES HE HAD NO TIME TO ASK HIMSELF 
WHETHER THESE PEOPLE WERE SINCERE OR NOT HE WAS ALWAYS 
BUSY AND ALWAYS FELT IN A STATE OF MILD AND CHEERFUL INTOXICA

EXPECTED OF HIM THAT IF HE DID NOT DO IT HE WOULD GRIEVE

WOULD BE WELL AND HE DID WHAT WAS DEMANDED OF HIM BUT 
STILL THAT HAPPY RESULT ALWAYS REMAINED IN THE FUTURE
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE PRINCE VASILI TOOK POSSESSION

PIERRES PEASANTS WHICH THE PRINCE HAD RETAINED FOR HIM 
SELF
IN PETERSBURG AS IN MOSCOW PIERRE FOUND THE SAME AT 
MOSPHERE OF GENTLENESS AND AFFECTION HE COULD NOT REFUSE 
THE POST OR RATHER THE RANK FOR HE DID NOTHING THAT PRINCE 
VASILI HAD PROCURED FOR HIM AND ACQUAINTANCES INVITA 
TIONS AND SOCIAL OCCUPATIONS WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT EVEN 
MORE THAN IN MOSCOW HE FELT A SENSE OF BEWILDERMENT BUS 
TLE AND CONTINUAL EXPECTATION OF SOME GOOD ALWAYS IN FRONT 
OF HIM BUT NEVER ATTAINED
OF HIS FORMER BACHELOR ACQUAINTANCES MANY WERE NO 
LONGER IN PETERSBURG THE GUARDS HAD GONE TO THE FRONT 
DOLOKHOV HAD BEEN REDUCED TO THE RANKS ANATOLE WAS 
IN THE ARMY SOMEWHERE IN THE PROVINCES PRINCE ANDREW 
WAS ABROAD SO PIERRE HAD NOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND 
HIS NIGHTS AS HE USED TO LIKE TO SPEND THEM OR TO OPEN HIS 
MIND BY INTIMATE TALKS WITH A FRIEND OLDER THAN HIMSELF AND 
WHOM HE RESPECTED HIS WHOLE TIME WAS TAKEN UP WITH DIN 
NERS AND BALLS AND WAS SPENT CHIEFLY AT PRINCE VASILIS HOUSE 
IN THE COMPANY OF THE STOUT PRINCESS HIS WIFE AND HIS BEAU 
TIFUL DAUGHTER HELENE
LIKE THE OTHERS ANNA PAVLOVNA SCHERER SHOWED PIERRE 
THE CHANGE OF ATTITUDE TOWARD HIM THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN 
SOCIETY
FORMERLY IN ANNA PAVLOVNAS PRESENCE PIERRE HAD AL 
WAYS FELT THAT WHAT HE WAS SAYING WAS OUT OF PLACE TACTLESS 
AND UNSUITABLE THAT REMARKS WHICH SEEMED TO HIM CLEVER 
WHILE THEY FORMED IN HIS MIND BECAME FOOLISH AS SOON AS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHE UTTERED THEM WHILE ON THE CONTRARY HIPPOLYTES STUPID 
EST REMARKS CAME OUT CLEVER AND APT NOW EVERYTHING PIERRE 
SAID WAS CHARMANT EVEN IF ANNA PAVLOVNA DID NOT SAY SO 
HE COULD SEE THAT SHE WISHED TO AND ONLY REFRAINED OUT OF RE 
GARD FOR HIS MODESTY
IN THE BEGINNING OF THE WINTER OF  PIERRE RECEIVED 
ONE OF ANNA PAVLOVNAS USUAL PINK NOTES WITH AN INVITA 
TION TO WHICH WAS ADDED YOU WILL FIND THE BEAUTIFUL HELENE 
HERE WHOM IT IS ALWAYS DELIGHTFUL TO SEE
WHEN HE READ THAT SENTENCE PIERRE FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
THAT SOME LINK WHICH OTHER PEOPLE RECOGNIZED HAD GROWN 
UP BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HELENE AND THAT THOUGHT BOTH 
ALARMED HIM AS IF SOME OBLIGATION WERE BEING IMPOSED ON 
HIM WHICH HE COULD NOT FULFILL AND PLEASED HIM AS AN ENTER 
TAINING SUPPOSITION
ANNA PAVLOVNAS AT HOME WAS LIKE THE FORMER ONE ONLY 
THE NOVELTY SHE OFFERED HER GUESTS THIS TIME WAS NOT MOR 
TEMART BUT A DIPLOMATIST FRESH FROM BERLIN WITH THE VERY 
LATEST DETAILS OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDERS VISIT TO POTSDAM 
AND OF HOW THE TWO AUGUST FRIENDS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES 
IN AN INDISSOLUBLE ALLIANCE TO UPHOLD THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE 
AGAINST THE ENEMY OF THE HUMAN RACE ANNA PAVLOVNA RE 
CEIVED PIERRE WITH A SHADE OF MELANCHOLY EVIDENTLY RELATING 
TO THE YOUNG MANS RECENT LOSS BY THE DEATH OF COUNT BE 
ZUKHOV EVERYONE CONSTANTLY CONSIDERED IT A DUTY TO ASSURE 
PIERRE THAT HE WAS GREATLY AFFLICTED BY THE DEATH OF THE FATHER 
HE HAD HARDLY KNOWN AND HER MELANCHOLY WAS JUST LIKE THE 
AUGUST MELANCHOLY SHE SHOWED AT THE MENTION OF HER MOST 
AUGUST MAJESTY THE EMPRESS MARYA FEDOROVNA PIERRE FELT WAR AND PEACE FLATTERED BY THIS ANNA PAVLOVNA ARRANGED THE DIFFERENT 
GROUPS IN HER DRAWING ROOM WITH HER HABITUAL SKILL THE 
LARGE GROUP IN WHICH WERE PRINCE VASILI AND THE GENERALS 
HAD THE BENEFIT OF THE DIPLOMAT ANOTHER GROUP WAS AT THE 
TEA TABLE PIERRE WISHED TO JOIN THE FORMER BUT ANNA PAVLOV 
NAWHO WAS IN THE EXCITED CONDITION OF A COMMANDER ON A 
BATTLEFIELD TO WHOM THOUSANDS OF NEW AND BRILLIANT IDEAS OC 
CUR WHICH THERE IS HARDLY TIME TO PUT IN ACTIONSEEING PIERRE 
TOUCHED HIS SLEEVE WITH HER FINGER SAYING
WAIT A BIT I HAVE SOMETHING IN VIEW FOR YOU THIS EVE 
NING SHE GLANCED AT HELENE AND SMILED AT HER MY DEAR 
HELENE BE CHARITABLE TO MY POOR AUNT WHO ADORES YOU GO 
AND KEEP HER COMPANY FOR TEN MINUTES AND THAT IT WILL NOT 
BE TOO DULL HERE IS THE DEAR COUNT WHO WILL NOT REFUSE TO AC 
COMPANY YOU
THE BEAUTY WENT TO THE AUNT BUT ANNA PAVLOVNA DETAINED 
PIERRE LOOKING AS IF SHE HAD TO GIVE SOME FINAL NECESSARY IN 
STRUCTIONS
ISNT SHE EXQUISITE SHE SAID TO PIERRE POINTING TO THE 
STATELY BEAUTY AS SHE GLIDED AWAY AND HOW SHE CARRIES HER 
SELF FOR SO YOUNG A GIRL SUCH TACT SUCH MASTERLY PERFECTION 
OF MANNER IT COMES FROM HER HEART HAPPY THE MAN WHO 
WINS HER WITH HER THE LEAST WORLDLY OF MEN WOULD OCCUPY 
A MOST BRILLIANT POSITION IN SOCIETY DONT YOU THINK SO I 
ONLY WANTED TO KNOW YOUR OPINION AND ANNA PAVLOVNA LET 
PIERRE GO
PIERRE IN REPLY SINCERELY AGREED WITH HER AS TO HELENES 
PERFECTION OF MANNER IF HE EVER THOUGHT OF HELENE IT WAS 
JUST OF HER BEAUTY AND HER REMARKABLE SKILL IN APPEARING SI  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMLENTLY DIGNIFIED IN SOCIETY
THE OLD AUNT RECEIVED THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE IN HER COR 
NER BUT SEEMED DESIROUS OF HIDING HER ADORATION FOR HELENE 
AND INCLINED RATHER TO SHOW HER FEAR OF ANNA PAVLOVNA 
SHE LOOKED AT HER NIECE AS IF INQUIRING WHAT SHE WAS TO DO 
WITH THESE PEOPLE ON LEAVING THEM ANNA PAVLOVNA AGAIN 
TOUCHED PIERRES SLEEVE SAYING I HOPE YOU WONT SAY THAT IT 
IS DULL IN MY HOUSE AGAIN AND SHE GLANCED AT HELENE
HELENE SMILED WITH A LOOK IMPLYING THAT SHE DID NOT 
ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANYONE SEEING HER WITHOUT BEING EN 
CHANTED THE AUNT COUGHED SWALLOWED AND SAID IN FRENCH 
THAT SHE WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE HELENE THEN SHE TURNED TO 
PIERRE WITH THE SAME WORDS OF WELCOME AND THE SAME LOOK 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A DULL AND HALTING CONVERSATION HELENE 
TURNED TO PIERRE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT SMILE THAT SHE 
GAVE TO EVERYONE PIERRE WAS SO USED TO THAT SMILE AND IT 
HAD SO LITTLE MEANING FOR HIM THAT HE PAID NO ATTENTION TO 
IT THE AUNT WAS JUST SPEAKING OF A COLLECTION OF SNUFFBOXES 
THAT HAD BELONGED TO PIERRES FATHER COUNT BEZUKHOV AND 
SHOWED THEM HER OWN BOX PRINCESS HELENE ASKED TO SEE THE 
PORTRAIT OF THE AUNTS HUSBAND ON THE BOX LID
THAT IS PROBABLY THE WORK OF VINESSE SAID PIERRE MEN 
TIONING A CELEBRATED MINIATURIST AND HE LEANED OVER THE 
TABLE TO TAKE THE SNUFFBOX WHILE TRYING TO HEAR WHAT WAS BE 
ING SAID AT THE OTHER TABLE
HE HALF ROSE MEANING TO GO ROUND BUT THE AUNT HANDED 
HIM THE SNUFFBOX PASSING IT ACROSS HELENES BACK HELENE 
STOOPED FORWARD TO MAKE ROOM AND LOOKED ROUND WITH A 
SMILE SHE WAS AS ALWAYS AT EVENING PARTIES WEARING A DRESS WAR AND PEACE SUCH AS WAS THEN FASHIONABLE CUT VERY LOW AT FRONT AND BACK 
HER BUST WHICH HAD ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE MARBLE TO PIERRE 
WAS SO CLOSE TO HIM THAT HIS SHORTSIGHTED EYES COULD NOT BUT 
PERCEIVE THE LIVING CHARM OF HER NECK AND SHOULDERS SO NEAR 
TO HIS LIPS THAT HE NEED ONLY HAVE BENT HIS HEAD A LITTLE TO 
HAVE TOUCHED THEM HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE WARMTH OF HER 
BODY THE SCENT OF PERFUME AND THE CREAKING OF HER CORSET 
AS SHE MOVED HE DID NOT SEE HER MARBLE BEAUTY FORMING 
A COMPLETE WHOLE WITH HER DRESS BUT ALL THE CHARM OF HER 
BODY ONLY COVERED BY HER GARMENTS AND HAVING ONCE SEEN 
THIS HE COULD NOT HELP BEING AWARE IT JUST AS WE CANNOT RE 
NEW AN ILLUSION WE HAVE ONCE SEEN THROUGH
SO YOU HAVE NEVER NOTICED BEFORE HOW BEAUTIFUL I AM 
HELENE SEEMED TO SAY YOU HAD NOT NOTICED THAT I AM A 
WOMAN YES I AM A WOMAN WHO MAY BELONG TO ANYONE 
TO YOU TOO SAID HER GLANCE AND AT THAT MOMENT PIERRE FELT 
THAT HELENE NOT ONLY COULD BUT MUST BE HIS WIFE AND THAT IT 
COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
HE KNEW THIS AT THAT MOMENT AS SURELY AS IF HE HAD BEEN 
STANDING AT THE ALTAR WITH HER HOW AND WHEN THIS WOULD BE 
HE DID NOT KNOW HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW IF IT WOULD BE A GOOD 
THING HE EVEN FELT HE KNEW NOT WHY THAT IT WOULD BE A BAD 
THING BUT HE KNEW IT WOULD HAPPEN
PIERRE DROPPED HIS EYES LIFTED THEM AGAIN AND WISHED 
ONCE MORE TO SEE HER AS A DISTANT BEAUTY FAR REMOVED FROM 
HIM AS HE HAD SEEN HER EVERY DAY UNTIL THEN BUT HE COULD 
NO LONGER DO IT HE COULD NOT ANY MORE THAN A MAN WHO 
HAS BEEN LOOKING AT A TUFT OF STEPPE GRASS THROUGH THE MIST 
AND TAKING IT FOR A TREE CAN AGAIN TAKE IT FOR A TREE AFTER HE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHAS ONCE RECOGNIZED IT TO BE A TUFT OF GRASS SHE WAS TERRIBLY 
CLOSE TO HIM SHE ALREADY HAD POWER OVER HIM AND BETWEEN 
THEM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY BARRIER EXCEPT THE BARRIER OF 
HIS OWN WILL
WELL I WILL LEAVE YOU IN YOUR LITTLE CORNER CAME ANNA 
PAVLOVNAS VOICE I SEE YOU ARE ALL RIGHT THERE
AND PIERRE ANXIOUSLY TRYING TO REMEMBER WHETHER HE 
HAD DONE ANYTHING REPREHENSIBLE LOOKED ROUND WITH A 
BLUSH IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT EVERYONE KNEW WHAT HAD HAP 
PENED TO HIM AS HE KNEW IT HIMSELF
A LITTLE LATER WHEN HE WENT UP TO THE LARGE CIRCLE ANNA 
PAVLOVNA SAID TO HIM I HEAR YOU ARE REFITTING YOUR PETERS 
BURG HOUSE
THIS WAS TRUE THE ARCHITECT HAD TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS NEC 
ESSARY AND PIERRE WITHOUT KNOWING WHY WAS HAVING HIS 
ENORMOUS PETERSBURG HOUSE DONE UP
THATS A GOOD THING BUT DONT MOVE FROM PRINCE VASILIS 
IT IS GOOD TO HAVE A FRIEND LIKE THE PRINCE SHE SAID SMILING 
AT PRINCE VASILI I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT DONT I AND 
YOU ARE STILL SO YOUNG YOU NEED ADVICE DONT BE ANGRY WITH 
ME FOR EXERCISING AN OLD WOMANS PRIVILEGE
SHE PAUSED AS WOMEN ALWAYS DO EXPECTING SOMETHING 
AFTER THEY HAVE MENTIONED THEIR AGE IF YOU MARRY IT WILL BE 
A DIFFERENT THING SHE CONTINUED UNITING THEM BOTH IN ONE 
GLANCE PIERRE DID NOT LOOK AT HELENE NOR SHE AT HIM BUT SHE 
WAS JUST AS TERRIBLY CLOSE TO HIM HE MUTTERED SOMETHING 
AND COLORED
WHEN HE GOT HOME HE COULD NOT SLEEP FOR A LONG TIME 
FOR THINKING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAR AND PEACE NOTHING HE HAD MERELY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WOMAN HE HAD 
KNOWN AS A CHILD OF WHOM WHEN HER BEAUTY WAS MENTIONED 
HE HAD SAID ABSENTMINDEDLY YES SHES GOOD LOOKING HE 
HAD UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT BELONG TO HIM
BUT SHES STUPID I HAVE MYSELF SAID SHE IS STUPID HE 
THOUGHT THERE IS SOMETHING NASTY SOMETHING WRONG IN 
THE FEELING SHE EXCITES IN ME I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT HER BROTH 
ER ANATOLE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER AND SHE WITH HIM THAT THERE 
WAS QUITE A SCANDAL AND THAT THATS WHY HE WAS SENT AWAY 
HIPPOLYTE IS HER BROTHER PRINCE VASILI IS HER FATHER ITS 
BAD HE REFLECTED BUT WHILE HE WAS THINKING THIS THE RE 
FLECTION WAS STILL INCOMPLETE HE CAUGHT HIMSELF SMILING AND 
WAS CONSCIOUS THAT ANOTHER LINE OF THOUGHT HAD SPRUNG UP 
AND WHILE THINKING OF HER WORTHLESSNESS HE WAS ALSO DREAM 
ING OF HOW SHE WOULD BE HIS WIFE HOW SHE WOULD LOVE HIM 
BECOME QUITE DIFFERENT AND HOW ALL HE HAD THOUGHT AND 
HEARD OF HER MIGHT BE FALSE AND HE AGAIN SAW HER NOT AS 
THE DAUGHTER OF PRINCE VASILI BUT VISUALIZED HER WHOLE BODY 
ONLY VEILED BY ITS GRAY DRESS BUT NO WHY DID THIS THOUGHT 
NEVER OCCUR TO ME BEFORE AND AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT 
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING UNNATU 
RAL AND AS IT SEEMED TO HIM DISHONORABLE IN THIS MARRIAGE 
HE RECALLED HER FORMER WORDS AND LOOKS AND THE WORDS AND 
LOOKS OF THOSE WHO HAD SEEN THEM TOGETHER HE RECALLED 
ANNA PAVLOVNAS WORDS AND LOOKS WHEN SHE SPOKE TO HIM 
ABOUT HIS HOUSE RECALLED THOUSANDS OF SUCH HINTS FROM 
PRINCE VASILI AND OTHERS AND WAS SEIZED BY TERROR LEST HE 
HAD ALREADY IN SOME WAY BOUND HIMSELF TO DO SOMETHING 
THAT WAS EVIDENTLY WRONG AND THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO DO BUT AT  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMTHE VERY TIME HE WAS EXPRESSING THIS CONVICTION TO HIMSELF 
IN ANOTHER PART OF HIS MIND HER IMAGE ROSE IN ALL ITS WOM 
ANLY BEAUTYWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER II
IN NOVEMBER  PRINCE VASILI HAD TO GO ON A TOUR OF IN 
SPECTION IN FOUR DIFFERENT PROVINCES HE HAD ARRANGED THIS 
FOR HIMSELF SO AS TO VISIT HIS NEGLECTED ESTATES AT THE SAME 
TIME AND PICK UP HIS SON ANATOLE WHERE HIS REGIMENT WAS 
STATIONED AND TAKE HIM TO VISIT PRINCE NICHOLAS BOLKONS 
KI IN ORDER TO ARRANGE A MATCH FOR HIM WITH THE DAUGHTER 
OF THAT RICH OLD MAN BUT BEFORE LEAVING HOME AND UNDER 
TAKING THESE NEW AFFAIRS PRINCE VASILI HAD TO SETTLE MATTERS 
WITH PIERRE WHO IT IS TRUE HAD LATTERLY SPENT WHOLE DAYS AT 
HOME THAT IS IN PRINCE VASILIS HOUSE WHERE HE WAS STAYING 
AND HAD BEEN ABSURD EXCITED AND FOOLISH IN HELENES PRES 
ENCE AS A LOVER SHOULD BE BUT HAD NOT YET PROPOSED TO HER
THIS IS ALL VERY FINE BUT THINGS MUST BE SETTLED SAID 
PRINCE VASILI TO HIMSELF WITH A SORROWFUL SIGH ONE MORN 
ING FEELING THAT PIERRE WHO WAS UNDER SUCH OBLIGATIONS TO 
HIM BUT NEVER MIND THAT WAS NOT BEHAVING VERY WELL 
IN THIS MATTER YOUTH FRIVOLITY WELL GOD BE WITH HIM 
THOUGHT HE RELISHING HIS OWN GOODNESS OF HEART BUT IT MUST 
BE BROUGHT TO A HEAD THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WILL BE LELYAS 
NAME DAY I WILL INVITE TWO OR THREE PEOPLE AND IF HE DOES 
NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO THEN IT WILL BE MY AF 
FAIRYES MY AFFAIR I AM HER FATHER
SIX WEEKS AFTER ANNA PAVLOVNAS AT HOME AND AFTER THE 
SLEEPLESS NIGHT WHEN HE HAD DECIDED THAT TO MARRY HELENE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWOULD BE A CALAMITY AND THAT HE OUGHT TO AVOID HER AND GO 
AWAY PIERRE DESPITE THAT DECISION HAD NOT LEFT PRINCE VASI 
LIS AND FELT WITH TERROR THAT IN PEOPLES EYES HE WAS EVERY DAY 
MORE AND MORE CONNECTED WITH HER THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE 
FOR HIM TO RETURN TO HIS FORMER CONCEPTION OF HER THAT HE 
COULD NOT BREAK AWAY FROM HER AND THAT THOUGH IT WOULD BE 
A TERRIBLE THING HE WOULD HAVE TO UNITE HIS FATE WITH HERS HE 
MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FREE HIMSELF BUT THAT PRINCE 
VASILI WHO HAD RARELY BEFORE GIVEN RECEPTIONS NOW HARDLY 
LET A DAY GO BY WITHOUT HAVING AN EVENING PARTY AT WHICH 
PIERRE HAD TO BE PRESENT UNLESS HE WISHED TO SPOIL THE GEN 
ERAL PLEASURE AND DISAPPOINT EVERYONES EXPECTATION PRINCE 
VASILI IN THE RARE MOMENTS WHEN HE WAS AT HOME WOULD 
TAKE PIERRES HAND IN PASSING AND DRAW IT DOWNWARDS OR 
ABSENTMINDEDLY HOLD OUT HIS WRINKLED CLEANSHAVEN CHEEK 
FOR PIERRE TO KISS AND WOULD SAY TILL TOMORROW OR BE IN 
TO DINNER OR I SHALL NOT SEE YOU OR I AM STAYING IN FOR YOUR 
SAKE AND SO ON AND THOUGH PRINCE VASILI WHEN HE STAYED 
IN AS HE SAID FOR PIERRES SAKE HARDLY EXCHANGED A COUPLE 
OF WORDS WITH HIM PIERRE FELT UNABLE TO DISAPPOINT HIM 
EVERY DAY HE SAID TO HIMSELF ONE AND THE SAME THING IT IS 
TIME I UNDERSTOOD HER AND MADE UP MY MIND WHAT SHE RE 
ALLY IS WAS I MISTAKEN BEFORE OR AM I MISTAKEN NOW NO 
SHE IS NOT STUPID SHE IS AN EXCELLENT GIRL HE SOMETIMES SAID 
TO HIMSELF SHE NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING 
STUPID SHE SAYS LITTLE BUT WHAT SHE DOES SAY IS ALWAYS CLEAR 
AND SIMPLE SO SHE IS NOT STUPID SHE NEVER WAS ABASHED AND 
IS NOT ABASHED NOW SO SHE CANNOT BE A BAD WOMAN HE HAD 
OFTEN BEGUN TO MAKE REFLECTIONS OR THINK ALOUD IN HER COM WAR AND PEACE PANY AND SHE HAD ALWAYS ANSWERED HIM EITHER BY A BRIEF BUT 
APPROPRIATE REMARKSHOWING THAT IT DID NOT INTEREST HEROR 
BY A SILENT LOOK AND SMILE WHICH MORE PALPABLY THAN ANY 
THING ELSE SHOWED PIERRE HER SUPERIORITY SHE WAS RIGHT IN 
REGARDING ALL ARGUMENTS AS NONSENSE IN COMPARISON WITH 
THAT SMILE
SHE ALWAYS ADDRESSED HIM WITH A RADIANTLY CONFIDING 
SMILE MEANT FOR HIM ALONE IN WHICH THERE WAS SOMETHING 
MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN IN THE GENERAL SMILE THAT USUALLY 
BRIGHTENED HER FACE PIERRE KNEW THAT EVERYONE WAS WAIT 
ING FOR HIM TO SAY A WORD AND CROSS A CERTAIN LINE AND HE 
KNEW THAT SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD STEP ACROSS IT BUT AN 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE TERROR SEIZED HIM AT THE THOUGHT OF THAT 
DREADFUL STEP A THOUSAND TIMES DURING THAT MONTH AND A 
HALF WHILE HE FELT HIMSELF DRAWN NEARER AND NEARER TO THAT 
DREADFUL ABYSS PIERRE SAID TO HIMSELF WHAT AM I DOING I 
NEED RESOLUTION CAN IT BE THAT I HAVE NONE
HE WISHED TO TAKE A DECISION BUT FELT WITH DISMAY THAT 
IN THIS MATTER HE LACKED THAT STRENGTH OF WILL WHICH HE HAD 
KNOWN IN HIMSELF AND REALLY POSSESSED PIERRE WAS ONE OF 
THOSE WHO ARE ONLY STRONG WHEN THEY FEEL THEMSELVES QUITE 
INNOCENT AND SINCE THAT DAY WHEN HE WAS OVERPOWERED BY 
A FEELING OF DESIRE WHILE STOOPING OVER THE SNUFFBOX AT ANNA 
PAVLOVNAS AN UNACKNOWLEDGED SENSE OF THE GUILT OF THAT DE 
SIRE PARALYZED HIS WILL
ON HELENES NAME DAY A SMALL PARTY OF JUST THEIR OWN 
PEOPLEAS HIS WIFE SAIDMET FOR SUPPER AT PRINCE VASILIS ALL 
THESE FRIENDS AND RELATIONS HAD BEEN GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT THE FATE OF THE YOUNG GIRL WOULD BE DECIDED THAT EVE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMNING THE VISITORS WERE SEATED AT SUPPER PRINCESS KURAGINA

AN OLD BARONESS THAT HE LOVED HER PASSIONATELY AT WHICH SHE 
LAUGHED AT THE OTHER COULD BE HEARD THE STORY OF THE MIS 
FORTUNES OF SOME MARY VIKTOROVNA OR OTHER AT THE CENTER 
OF THE TABLE PRINCE VASILI ATTRACTED EVERYBODYS ATTENTION 
WITH A FACETIOUS SMILE ON HIS FACE HE WAS TELLING THE LADIES 
ABOUT LAST WEDNESDAYS MEETING OF THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL AT 
WHICH SERGEY KUZMICH VYAZMITINOV THE NEW MILITARY GOV 
ERNOR GENERAL OF PETERSBURG HAD RECEIVED AND READ THE THEN 
FAMOUS RESCRIPT OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER FROM THE ARMY

RECEIVING FROM ALL SIDES DECLARATIONS OF THE PEOPLES LOYALTY WAR AND PEACE THAT THE DECLARATION FROM PETERSBURG GAVE HIM PARTICULAR 
PLEASURE AND THAT HE WAS PROUD TO BE AT THE HEAD OF SUCH A 
NATION AND WOULD ENDEAVOR TO BE WORTHY OF IT THIS RESCRIPT

HIGH SPIRITS AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A VARIETY OF EXCITING 
SENSATIONS ONLY PIERRE AND HELENE SAT SILENTLY SIDE BY SIDE 
ALMOST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE A SUPPRESSED SMILE BRIGHT 
ENING BOTH THEIR FACES A SMILE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 
SERGEY KUZMICHA SMILE OF BASHFULNESS AT THEIR OWN FEELINGS 
BUT MUCH AS ALL THE REST LAUGHED TALKED AND JOKED MUCH  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMAS THEY ENJOYED THEIR RHINE WINE SAUTE AND ICES AND HOW 
EVER THEY AVOIDED LOOKING AT THE YOUNG COUPLE AND HEEDLESS 
AND UNOBSERVANT AS THEY SEEMED OF THEM ONE COULD FEEL BY 
THE OCCASIONAL GLANCES THEY GAVE THAT THE STORY ABOUT SERGEY 
KUZMICH THE LAUGHTER AND THE FOOD WERE ALL A PRETENSE 
AND THAT THE WHOLE ATTENTION OF THAT COMPANY WAS DIRECTED 
TOPIERRE AND HELENE PRINCE VASILI MIMICKED THE SOBBING 
OF SERGEY KUZMICH AND AT THE SAME TIME HIS EYES GLANCED 
TOWARD HIS DAUGHTER AND WHILE HE LAUGHED THE EXPRESSION 
ON HIS FACE CLEARLY SAID YES ITS GETTING ON IT WILL ALL BE 
SETTLED TODAY ANNA PAVLOVNA THREATENED HIM ON BEHALF OF 
OUR DEAR VYAZMITINOV AND IN HER EYES WHICH FOR AN IN 
STANT GLANCED AT PIERRE PRINCE VASILI READ A CONGRATULATION 
ON HIS FUTURE SONINLAW AND ON HIS DAUGHTERS HAPPINESS 
THE OLD PRINCESS SIGHED SADLY AS SHE OFFERED SOME WINE TO 
THE OLD LADY NEXT TO HER AND GLANCED ANGRILY AT HER DAUGH 
TER AND HER SIGH SEEMED TO SAY YES THERES NOTHING LEFT FOR 
YOU AND ME BUT TO SIP SWEET WINE MY DEAR NOW THAT THE 
TIME HAS COME FOR THESE YOUNG ONES TO BE THUS BOLDLY PRO 
VOCATIVELY HAPPY AND WHAT NONSENSE ALL THIS IS THAT I AM 
SAYING THOUGHT A DIPLOMATIST GLANCING AT THE HAPPY FACES 
OF THE LOVERS THATS HAPPINESS
INTO THE INSIGNIFICANT TRIFLING AND ARTIFICIAL INTERESTS 
UNITING THAT SOCIETY HAD ENTERED THE SIMPLE FEELING OF THE AT 
TRACTION OF A HEALTHY AND HANDSOME YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN 
FOR ONE ANOTHER AND THIS HUMAN FEELING DOMINATED EVERY 
THING ELSE AND SOARED ABOVE ALL THEIR AFFECTED CHATTER JESTS 
FELL FLAT NEWS WAS NOT INTERESTING AND THE ANIMATION WAS 
EVIDENTLY FORCED NOT ONLY THE GUESTS BUT EVEN THE FOOTMEN WAR AND PEACE WAITING AT TABLE SEEMED TO FEEL THIS AND THEY FORGOT THEIR DU 
TIES AS THEY LOOKED AT THE BEAUTIFUL HELENE WITH HER RADIANT 
FACE AND AT THE RED BROAD AND HAPPY THOUGH UNEASY FACE OF 
PIERRE IT SEEMED AS IF THE VERY LIGHT OF THE CANDLES WAS FO 
CUSED ON THOSE TWO HAPPY FACES ALONE
PIERRE FELT THAT HE THE CENTER OF IT ALL AND THIS BOTH PLEASED 
AND EMBARRASSED HIM HE WAS LIKE A MAN ENTIRELY ABSORBED 
IN SOME OCCUPATION HE DID NOT SEE HEAR OR UNDERSTAND 
ANYTHING CLEARLY ONLY NOW AND THEN DETACHED IDEAS AND 
IMPRESSIONS FROM THE WORLD OF REALITY SHOT UNEXPECTEDLY 
THROUGH HIS MIND
SO IT IS ALL FINISHED HE THOUGHT AND HOW HAS IT ALL HAP 
PENED HOW QUICKLY NOW I KNOW THAT NOT BECAUSE OF HER 
ALONE NOR OF MYSELF ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF EVERYONE IT MUST 
INEVITABLY COME ABOUT THEY ARE ALL EXPECTING IT THEY ARE SO 
SURE THAT IT WILL HAPPEN THAT I CANNOT I CANNOT DISAPPOINT 
THEM BUT HOW WILL IT BE I DO NOT KNOW BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY 
HAPPEN THOUGHT PIERRE GLANCING AT THOSE DAZZLING SHOUL 
DERS CLOSE TO HIS EYES
OR HE WOULD SUDDENLY FEEL ASHAMED OF HE KNEW NOT WHAT 
HE FELT IT AWKWARD TO ATTRACT EVERYONES ATTENTION AND TO 
BE CONSIDERED A LUCKY MAN AND WITH HIS PLAIN FACE TO BE 
LOOKED ON AS A SORT OF PARIS POSSESSED OF A HELEN BUT NO 
DOUBT IT ALWAYS IS AND MUST BE SO HE CONSOLED HIMSELF AND 
BESIDES WHAT HAVE I DONE TO BRING IT ABOUT HOW DID IT BE 
GIN I TRAVELED FROM MOSCOW WITH PRINCE VASILI THEN THERE 
WAS NOTHING SO WHY SHOULD I NOT STAY AT HIS HOUSE THEN I 
PLAYED CARDS WITH HER AND PICKED UP HER RETICULE AND DROVE 
OUT WITH HER HOW DID IT BEGIN WHEN DID IT ALL COME ABOUT  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMAND HERE HE WAS SITTING BY HER SIDE AS HER BETROTHED SEEING 
HEARING FEELING HER NEARNESS HER BREATHING HER MOVE 
MENTS HER BEAUTY THEN IT WOULD SUDDENLY SEEM TO HIM 
THAT IT WAS NOT SHE BUT HE WAS SO UNUSUALLY BEAUTIFUL AND 
THAT THAT WAS WHY THEY ALL LOOKED SO AT HIM AND FLATTERED 
BY THIS GENERAL ADMIRATION HE WOULD EXPAND HIS CHEST RAISE 
HIS HEAD AND REJOICE AT HIS GOOD FORTUNE SUDDENLY HE HEARD 
A FAMILIAR VOICE REPEATING SOMETHING TO HIM A SECOND TIME 
BUT PIERRE WAS SO ABSORBED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT 
WAS SAID
I AM ASKING YOU WHEN YOU LAST HEARD FROM BOLKONSKI 
REPEATED PRINCE VASILI A THIRD TIME HOW ABSENTMINDED 
YOU ARE MY DEAR FELLOW
PRINCE VASILI SMILED AND PIERRE NOTICED THAT EVERYONE 
WAS SMILING AT HIM AND HELENE WELL WHAT OF IT IF YOU ALL 
KNOW IT THOUGHT PIERRE WHAT OF IT ITS THE TRUTH AND HE 
HIMSELF SMILED HIS GENTLE CHILDLIKE SMILE AND HELENE SMILED 
TOO
WHEN DID YOU GET THE LETTER WAS IT FROM OLMUTZ RE 
PEATED PRINCE VASILI WHO PRETENDED TO WANT TO KNOW THIS IN 
ORDER TO SETTLE A DISPUTE
HOW CAN ONE TALK OR THINK OF SUCH TRIFLES THOUGHT 
PIERRE
YES FROM OLMUTZ HE ANSWERED WITH A SIGH
AFTER SUPPER PIERRE WITH HIS PARTNER FOLLOWED THE OTHERS 
INTO THE DRAWING ROOM THE GUESTS BEGAN TO DISPERSE SOME 
WITHOUT TAKING LEAVE OF HELENE SOME AS IF UNWILLING TO DIS 
TRACT HER FROM AN IMPORTANT OCCUPATION CAME UP TO HER FOR 
A MOMENT AND MADE HASTE TO GO AWAY REFUSING TO LET HER SEE WAR AND PEACE THEM OFF THE DIPLOMATIST PRESERVED A MOURNFUL SILENCE AS 
HE LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM HE PICTURED THE VANITY OF HIS DIP 
LOMATIC CAREER IN COMPARISON WITH PIERRES HAPPINESS THE 
OLD GENERAL GRUMBLED AT HIS WIFE WHEN SHE ASKED HOW HIS 
LEG WAS OH THE OLD FOOL HE THOUGHT THAT PRINCESS HELENE 
WILL BE BEAUTIFUL STILL WHEN SHES FIFTY
I THINK I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU WHISPERED ANNA PAV 
LOVNA TO THE OLD PRINCESS KISSING HER SOUNDLY IF I HADNT 
THIS HEADACHE ID HAVE STAYED LONGER
THE OLD PRINCESS DID NOT REPLY SHE WAS TORMENTED BY JEAL 
OUSY OF HER DAUGHTERS HAPPINESS
WHILE THE GUESTS WERE TAKING THEIR LEAVE PIERRE REMAINED 
FOR A LONG TIME ALONE WITH HELENE IN THE LITTLE DRAWING ROOM 
WHERE THEY WERE SITTING HE HAD OFTEN BEFORE DURING THE 
LAST SIX WEEKS REMAINED ALONE WITH HER BUT HAD NEVER SPO 
KEN TO HER OF LOVE NOW HE FELT THAT IT WAS INEVITABLE BUT HE 
COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE THE FINAL STEP HE FELT 
ASHAMED HE FELT THAT HE WAS OCCUPYING SOMEONE ELSES PLACE 
HERE BESIDE HELENE THIS HAPPINESS IS NOT FOR YOU SOME IN 
NER VOICE WHISPERED TO HIM THIS HAPPINESS IS FOR THOSE WHO 
HAVE NOT IN THEM WHAT THERE IS IN YOU
BUT AS HE HAD TO SAY SOMETHING HE BEGAN BY ASKING HER 
WHETHER SHE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE PARTY SHE REPLIED IN HER 
USUAL SIMPLE MANNER THAT THIS NAME DAY OF HERS HAD BEEN 
ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST SHE HAD EVER HAD
SOME OF THE NEAREST RELATIVES HAD NOT YET LEFT THEY WERE 
SITTING IN THE LARGE DRAWING ROOM PRINCE VASILI CAME UP TO 
PIERRE WITH LANGUID FOOTSTEPS PIERRE ROSE AND SAID IT WAS 
GETTING LATE PRINCE VASILI GAVE HIM A LOOK OF STERN INQUI  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMRY AS THOUGH WHAT PIERRE HAD JUST SAID WAS SO STRANGE THAT 
ONE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN BUT THEN THE EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY 
CHANGED AND HE DREW PIERRES HAND DOWNWARDS MADE HIM 
SIT DOWN AND SMILED AFFECTIONATELY
WELL LELYA HE ASKED TURNING INSTANTLY TO HIS DAUGHTER 
AND ADDRESSING HER WITH THE CARELESS TONE OF HABITUAL TEN 
DERNESS NATURAL TO PARENTS WHO HAVE PETTED THEIR CHILDREN 
FROM BABYHOOD BUT WHICH PRINCE VASILI HAD ONLY ACQUIRED 
BY IMITATING OTHER PARENTS
AND HE AGAIN TURNED TO PIERRE
SERGEY KUZMICHFROM ALL SIDES HE SAID UNBUTTONING 
THE TOP BUTTON OF HIS WAISTCOAT
PIERRE SMILED BUT HIS SMILE SHOWED THAT HE KNEW IT WAS 
NOT THE STORY ABOUT SERGEY KUZMICH THAT INTERESTED PRINCE 
VASILI JUST THEN AND PRINCE VASILI SAW THAT PIERRE KNEW THIS 
HE SUDDENLY MUTTERED SOMETHING AND WENT AWAY IT SEEMED 
TO PIERRE THAT EVEN THE PRINCE WAS DISCONCERTED THE SIGHT

GOODHEARTED LAD AN EXCELLENT SON OR KINSMAN
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT WELL SEE
AS ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN WOMEN LEAD LONELY LIVES FOR ANY 
LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT MALE SOCIETY ON ANATOLES APPEAR 
ANCE ALL THE THREE WOMEN OF PRINCE BOLKONSKIS HOUSEHOLD 
FELT THAT THEIR LIFE HAD NOT BEEN REAL TILL THEN THEIR POWERS 
OF REASONING FEELING AND OBSERVING IMMEDIATELY INCREASED 
TENFOLD AND THEIR LIFE WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PASSED IN 
DARKNESS WAS SUDDENLY LIT UP BY A NEW BRIGHTNESS FULL OF 
SIGNIFICANCE
PRINCESS MARY GREW QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF HER FACE AND 
COIFFURE THE HANDSOME OPEN FACE OF THE MAN WHO MIGHT 
PERHAPS BE HER HUSBAND ABSORBED ALL HER ATTENTION HE 
SEEMED TO HER KIND BRAVE DETERMINED MANLY AND MAG 
NANIMOUS SHE FELT CONVINCED OF THAT THOUSANDS OF DREAMS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMOF A FUTURE FAMILY LIFE CONTINUALLY ROSE IN HER IMAGINATION 
SHE DROVE THEM AWAY AND TRIED TO CONCEAL THEM
BUT AM I NOT TOO COLD WITH HIM THOUGHT THE PRINCESS I 
TRY TO BE RESERVED BECAUSE IN THE DEPTH OF MY SOUL I FEEL TOO 
NEAR TO HIM ALREADY BUT THEN HE CANNOT KNOW WHAT I THINK 
OF HIM AND MAY IMAGINE THAT I DO NOT LIKE HIM
AND PRINCESS MARY TRIED BUT COULD NOT MANAGE TO BE 
CORDIAL TO HER NEW GUEST POOR GIRL SHES DEVILISH UGLY 
THOUGHT ANATOLE
MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE ALSO ROUSED TO GREAT EXCITEMENT 
BY ANATOLES ARRIVAL THOUGHT IN ANOTHER WAY OF COURSE SHE 
A HANDSOME YOUNG WOMAN WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE POSITION 
WITHOUT RELATIONS OR EVEN A COUNTRY DID NOT INTEND TO DE 
VOTE HER LIFE TO SERVING PRINCE BOLKONSKI TO READING ALOUD 
TO HIM AND BEING FRIENDS WITH PRINCESS MARY MADEMOISELLE 
BOURIENNE HAD LONG BEEN WAITING FOR A RUSSIAN PRINCE WHO 
ABLE TO APPRECIATE AT A GLANCE HER SUPERIORITY TO THE PLAIN 
BADLY DRESSED UNGAINLY RUSSIAN PRINCESSES WOULD FALL IN 
LOVE WITH HER AND CARRY HER OFF AND HERE AT LAST WAS A RUS 
SIAN PRINCE MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE KNEW A STORY HEARD 
FROM HER AUNT BUT FINISHED IN HER OWN WAY WHICH SHE LIKED 
TO REPEAT TO HERSELF IT WAS THE STORY OF A GIRL WHO HAD BEEN 
SEDUCED AND TO WHOM HER POOR MOTHER SA PAUVRE MERE 
APPEARED AND REPROACHED HER FOR YIELDING TO A MAN WITHOUT 
BEING MARRIED MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE WAS OFTEN TOUCHED 
TO TEARS AS IN IMAGINATION SHE TOLD THIS STORY TO HIM HER SE 
DUCER AND NOW HE A REAL RUSSIAN PRINCE HAD APPEARED HE 
WOULD CARRY HER AWAY AND THEN SA PAUVRE MERE WOULD AP 
PEAR AND HE WOULD MARRY HER SO HER FUTURE SHAPED ITSELF WAR AND PEACE IN MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNES HEAD AT THE VERY TIME SHE WAS 
TALKING TO ANATOLE ABOUT PARIS IT WAS NOT CALCULATION THAT 
GUIDED HER SHE DID NOT EVEN FOR A MOMENT CONSIDER WHAT 
SHE SHOULD DO BUT ALL THIS HAD LONG BEEN FAMILIAR TO HER 
AND NOW THAT ANATOLE HAD APPEARED IT JUST GROUPED ITSELF 
AROUND HIM AND SHE WISHED AND TRIED TO PLEASE HIM AS MUCH 
AS POSSIBLE
THE LITTLE PRINCESS LIKE AN OLD WAR HORSE THAT HEARS THE 
TRUMPET UNCONSCIOUSLY AND QUITE FORGETTING HER CONDITION 
PREPARED FOR THE FAMILIAR GALLOP OF COQUETRY WITHOUT ANY 
ULTERIOR MOTIVE OR ANY STRUGGLE BUT WITH NAIVE AND LIGHT 
HEARTED GAIETY
ALTHOUGH IN FEMALE SOCIETY ANATOLE USUALLY ASSUMED THE 
ROLE OF A MAN TIRED OF BEING RUN AFTER BY WOMEN HIS VANITY 
WAS FLATTERED BY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS POWER OVER THESE THREE 
WOMEN BESIDES THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL FOR THE PRETTY 
AND PROVOCATIVE MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE THAT PASSIONATE 
ANIMAL FEELING WHICH WAS APT TO MASTER HIM WITH GREAT SUD 
DENNESS AND PROMPT HIM TO THE COARSEST AND MOST RECKLESS 
ACTIONS

PRINCESS MARY WAS ASKED TO PLAY ON THE CLAVICHORD ANA 
TOLE LAUGHING AND IN HIGH SPIRITS CAME AND LEANED ON HIS 
ELBOWS FACING HER AND BESIDE MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE 
PRINCESS MARY FELT HIS LOOK WITH A PAINFULLY JOYOUS EMOTION 
HER FAVORITE SONATA BORE HER INTO A MOST INTIMATELY POETIC 
WORLD AND THE LOOK SHE FELT UPON HER MADE THAT WORLD STILL 
MORE POETIC BUT ANATOLES EXPRESSION THOUGH HIS EYES WERE 
FIXED ON HER REFERRED NOT TO HER BUT TO THE MOVEMENTS OF  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMMADEMOISELLE BOURIENNES LITTLE FOOT WHICH HE WAS THEN 
TOUCHING WITH HIS OWN UNDER THE CLAVICHORD MADEMOISELLE 
BOURIENNE WAS ALSO LOOKING AT PRINCESS MARY AND IN HER 
LOVELY EYES THERE WAS A LOOK OF FEARFUL JOY AND HOPE THAT WAS 
ALSO NEW TO THE PRINCESS
HOW SHE LOVES ME THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY HOW HAPPY 
I AM NOW AND HOW HAPPY I MAY BE WITH SUCH A FRIEND AND 
SUCH A HUSBAND HUSBAND CAN IT BE POSSIBLE SHE THOUGHT 
NOT DARING TO LOOK AT HIS FACE BUT STILL FEELING HIS EYES GAZ 
ING AT HER
IN THE EVENING AFTER SUPPER WHEN ALL WERE ABOUT TO RE 
TIRE ANATOLE KISSED PRINCESS MARYS HAND SHE DID NOT KNOW 
HOW SHE FOUND THE COURAGE BUT SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO HIS 
HANDSOME FACE AS IT CAME NEAR TO HER SHORTSIGHTED EYES 
TURNING FROM PRINCESS MARY HE WENT UP AND KISSED MA 
DEMOISELLE BOURIENNES HAND THIS WAS NOT ETIQUETTE BUT 
THEN HE DID EVERYTHING SO SIMPLY AND WITH SUCH ASSURANCE 
MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE FLUSHED AND GAVE THE PRINCESS A 
FRIGHTENED LOOK
WHAT DELICACY  THOUGHT THE PRINCESS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT 
AMELIE MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE THINKS I COULD BE JEAL 
OUS OF HER AND NOT VALUE HER PURE AFFECTION AND DEVOTION

SOMEONE NOW SMILING AT SOMEONE NOW WORKING HERSELF UP 
TO TEARS WITH THE IMAGINARY WORDS OF HER PAUVRE MERE RE 
BUKING HER FOR HER FALL
THE LITTLE PRINCESS GRUMBLED TO HER MAID THAT HER BED WAS 
BADLY MADE SHE COULD NOT LIE EITHER ON HER FACE OR ON HER 
SIDE EVERY POSITION WAS AWKWARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND 
HER BURDEN OPPRESSED HER NOW MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE ANA 
TOLES PRESENCE HAD VIVIDLY RECALLED TO HER THE TIME WHEN SHE 
WAS NOT LIKE THAT AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS LIGHT AND GAY  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMSHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR IN HER DRESSING JACKET AND NIGHTCAP 
AND KATIE SLEEPY AND DISHEVELED BEAT AND TURNED THE HEAVY

I TOLD YOU IT WAS ALL LUMPS AND HOLES THE LITTLE PRINCESS 
REPEATED I SHOULD BE GLAD ENOUGH TO FALL ASLEEP SO ITS NOT 
MY FAULT AND HER VOICE QUIVERED LIKE THAT OF A CHILD ABOUT 
TO CRY
THE OLD PRINCE DID NOT SLEEP EITHER TIKHON HALF ASLEEP 
HEARD HIM PACING ANGRILY ABOUT AND SNORTING THE OLD PRINCE 
FELT AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INSULTED THROUGH HIS DAUGHTER 
THE INSULT WAS THE MORE POINTED BECAUSE IT CONCERNED NOT 
HIMSELF BUT ANOTHER HIS DAUGHTER WHOM HE LOVED MORE 
THAN HIMSELF HE KEPT TELLING HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD CON 
SIDER THE WHOLE MATTER AND DECIDE WHAT WAS RIGHT AND HOW 
HE SHOULD ACT BUT INSTEAD OF THAT HE ONLY EXCITED HIMSELF 
MORE AND MORE
THE FIRST MAN THAT TURNS UPSHE FORGETS HER FATHER AND EV 
ERYTHING ELSE RUNS UPSTAIRS AND DOES UP HER HAIR AND WAGS 
HER TAIL AND IS UNLIKE HERSELF GLAD TO THROW HER FATHER OVER 
AND SHE KNEW I SHOULD NOTICE IT FR FR FR AND DONT I SEE 
THAT THAT IDIOT HAD EYES ONLY FOR BOURIENNEI SHALL HAVE TO GET 
RID OF HER AND HOW IS IT SHE HAS NOT PRIDE ENOUGH TO SEE IT 
IF SHE HAS NO PRIDE FOR HERSELF SHE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE SOME 
FOR MY SAKE SHE MUST BE SHOWN THAT THE BLOCKHEAD THINKS 
NOTHING OF HER AND LOOKS ONLY AT BOURIENNE NO SHE HAS NO 
PRIDE BUT ILL LET HER SEE
THE OLD PRINCE KNEW THAT IF HE TOLD HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS 
MAKING A MISTAKE AND THAT ANATOLE MEANT TO FLIRT WITH MA 
DEMOISELLE BOURIENNE PRINCESS MARYS SELFESTEEM WOULD WAR AND PEACE BE WOUNDED AND HIS POINT NOT TO BE PARTED FROM HER WOULD

NO GOOD NO GOOD SAID THE PRINCE RAPIDLY AND THRUST 
ING HIS FEET INTO HIS SLIPPERS AND HIS ARMS INTO THE SLEEVES OF

DEMOISELLE BOURIENNE THEY QUITE UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER 
AS TO THE FIRST PART OF THEIR ROMANCE UP TO THE APPEARANCE

ATTACK WAS AND WERE EXPECTING TO HEAR JUST SUCH A STORYTHEY

NOT HAPPENED TO HIM HE COULD NOT TELL THEM SIMPLY THAT 
EVERYONE WENT AT A TROT AND THAT HE FELL OFF HIS HORSE AND 
SPRAINED HIS ARM AND THEN RAN AS HARD AS HE COULD FROM A

MERE STRANGER GLANCING HOWEVER AT BORIS HE SAW THAT HE 
TOO SEEMED ASHAMED OF THE HUSSAR OF THE LINE

TURNED TO ROSTOV WHOSE STATE OF UNCONQUERABLE CHILDISH 
EMBARRASSMENT NOW CHANGING TO ANGER HE DID NOT CONDE 
SCEND TO NOTICE AND SAID I THINK YOU WERE TALKING OF THE

TUNE TO DISPLEASE YOU HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW 
MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DONT FORGET THAT I DO NOT 
REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED

DROP WELL THEN ON FRIDAY AFTER THE REVIEW I SHALL EXPECT 
YOU DRUBETSKOY AU REVOIR EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND 
WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
ONLY WHEN PRINCE ANDREW WAS GONE DID ROSTOV THINK 
OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY 
AT HAVING OMITTED TO SAY IT HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE 
AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE HOME SHOULD HE GO 
TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED AD WAR AND PEACE JUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT 
WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY HE THOUGHT ANGRILY OF THE PLEASURE 
HE WOULD HAVE AT SEEING THE FRIGHT OF THAT SMALL AND FRAIL 
BUT PROUD MAN WHEN COVERED BY HIS PISTOL AND THEN HE FELT 
WITH SURPRISE THAT OF ALL THE MEN HE KNEW THERE WAS NONE HE

FICERS COMMAND TURNED WITH BANNERS FLYING FORMED UP AT 
INTERVALS AND WHEELED ROUND OTHER SIMILAR MASSES OF INFAN 
TRY IN DIFFERENT UNIFORMS NOW WAS HEARD THE RHYTHMIC BEAT 
OF HOOFS AND THE JINGLING OF SHOWY CAVALRY IN BLUE RED AND 
GREEN BRAIDED UNIFORMS WITH SMARTLY DRESSED BANDSMEN IN 
FRONT MOUNTED ON BLACK ROAN OR GRAY HORSES THEN AGAIN 
SPREADING OUT WITH THE BRAZEN CLATTER OF THE POLISHED SHIN 
ING CANNON THAT QUIVERED ON THE GUN CARRIAGES AND WITH THE 
SMELL OF LINSTOCKS CAME THE ARTILLERY WHICH CRAWLED BETWEEN 
THE INFANTRY AND CAVALRY AND TOOK UP ITS APPOINTED POSITION 
NOT ONLY THE GENERALS IN FULL PARADE UNIFORMS WITH THEIR 
THIN OR THICK WAISTS DRAWN IN TO THE UTMOST THEIR RED NECKS 
SQUEEZED INTO THEIR STIFF COLLARS AND WEARING SCARVES AND ALL 
THEIR DECORATIONS NOT ONLY THE ELEGANT POMADED OFFICERS 
BUT EVERY SOLDIER WITH HIS FRESHLY WASHED AND SHAVEN FACE WAR AND PEACE AND HIS WEAPONS CLEAN AND POLISHED TO THE UTMOST AND EV 
ERY HORSE GROOMED TILL ITS COAT SHONE LIKE SATIN AND EVERY 
HAIR OF ITS WETTED MANE LAY SMOOTHFELT THAT NO SMALL MATTER 
WAS HAPPENING BUT AN IMPORTANT AND SOLEMN AFFAIR EVERY 
GENERAL AND EVERY SOLDIER WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN INSIGNIF 
ICANCE AWARE OF BEING BUT A DROP IN THAT OCEAN OF MEN AND 
YET AT THE SAME TIME WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS STRENGTH AS A PART 
OF THAT ENORMOUS WHOLE
FROM EARLY MORNING STRENUOUS ACTIVITIES AND EFFORTS HAD 
BEGUN AND BY TEN OCLOCK ALL HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO DUE OR 
DER THE RANKS WERE DROWN UP ON THE VAST FIELD THE WHOLE 
ARMY WAS EXTENDED IN THREE LINES THE CAVALRY IN FRONT BE 
HIND IT THE ARTILLERY AND BEHIND THAT AGAIN THE INFANTRY
A SPACE LIKE A STREET WAS LEFT BETWEEN EACH TWO LINES OF 
TROOPS THE THREE PARTS OF THAT ARMY WERE SHARPLY DISTIN 
GUISHED KUTUZOVS FIGHTING ARMY WITH THE PAVLOGRADS ON 
THE RIGHT FLANK OF THE FRONT THOSE RECENTLY ARRIVED FROM 
RUSSIA BOTH GUARDS AND REGIMENTS OF THE LINE AND THE AUS 
TRIAN TROOPS BUT THEY ALL STOOD IN THE SAME LINES UNDER ONE 
COMMAND AND IN A LIKE ORDER
LIKE WIND OVER LEAVES RAN AN EXCITED WHISPER THEYRE 
COMING THEYRE COMING ALARMED VOICES WERE HEARD AND A 
STIR OF FINAL PREPARATION SWEPT OVER ALL THE TROOPS
FROM THE DIRECTION OF OLMUTZ IN FRONT OF THEM A GROUP 
WAS SEEN APPROACHING AND AT THAT MOMENT THOUGH THE DAY 
WAS STILL A LIGHT GUST OF WIND BLOWING OVER THE ARMY SLIGHTLY 
STIRRED THE STREAMERS ON THE LANCES AND THE UNFOLDED STAN 
DARDS FLUTTERED AGAINST THEIR STAFFS IT LOOKED AS IF BY THAT 
SLIGHT MOTION THE ARMY ITSELF WAS EXPRESSING ITS JOY AT THE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMAPPROACH OF THE EMPERORS ONE VOICE WAS HEARD SHOUTING 
EYES FRONT THEN LIKE THE CROWING OF COCKS AT SUNRISE THIS 
WAS REPEATED BY OTHERS FROM VARIOUS SIDES AND ALL BECAME 
SILENT
IN THE DEATHLIKE STILLNESS ONLY THE TRAMP OF HORSES WAS 
HEARD THIS WAS THE EMPERORS SUITES THE EMPERORS RODE 
UP TO THE FLANK AND THE TRUMPETS OF THE FIRST CAVALRY REGI 
MENT PLAYED THE GENERAL MARCH IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NOT THE 
TRUMPETERS WERE PLAYING BUT AS IF THE ARMY ITSELF REJOICING 
AT THE EMPERORS APPROACH HAD NATURALLY BURST INTO MUSIC 
AMID THESE SOUNDS ONLY THE YOUTHFUL KINDLY VOICE OF THE 
EMPEROR ALEXANDER WAS CLEARLY HEARD HE GAVE THE WORDS OF 
GREETING AND THE FIRST REGIMENT ROARED HURRAH SO DEAFEN 
INGLY CONTINUOUSLY AND JOYFULLY THAT THE MEN THEMSELVES 
WERE AWED BY THEIR MULTITUDE AND THE IMMENSITY OF THE 
POWER THEY CONSTITUTED
ROSTOV STANDING IN THE FRONT LINES OF KUTUZOVS ARMY 
WHICH THE TSAR APPROACHED FIRST EXPERIENCED THE SAME 
FEELING AS EVERY OTHER MAN IN THAT ARMY A FEELING OF SELFFOR 
GETFULNESS A PROUD CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIGHT AND A PASSIONATE 
ATTRACTION TO HIM WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS TRIUMPH
HE FELT THAT AT A SINGLE WORD FROM THAT MAN ALL THIS VAST 
MASS AND HE HIMSELF AN INSIGNIFICANT ATOM IN IT WOULD GO 
THROUGH FIRE AND WATER COMMIT CRIME DIE OR PERFORM DEEDS 
OF HIGHEST HEROISM AND SO HE COULD NOT BUT TREMBLE AND HIS 
HEART STAND STILL AT THE IMMINENCE OF THAT WORD
HURRAH HURRAH HURRAH THUNDERED FROM ALL SIDES ONE 
REGIMENT AFTER ANOTHER GREETING THE TSAR WITH THE STRAINS OF 
THE MARCH AND THEN HURRAH THEN THE GENERAL MARCH WAR AND PEACE AND AGAIN HURRAH HURRAH GROWING EVER STRONGER AND 
FULLER AND MERGING INTO A DEAFENING ROAR
TILL THE TSAR REACHED IT EACH REGIMENT IN ITS SILENCE AND 
IMMOBILITY SEEMED LIKE A LIFELESS BODY BUT AS SOON AS HE 
CAME UP IT BECAME ALIVE ITS THUNDER JOINING THE ROAR OF THE 
WHOLE LINE ALONG WHICH HE HAD ALREADY PASSED THROUGH THE 
TERRIBLE AND DEAFENING ROAR OF THOSE VOICES AMID THE SQUARE 
MASSES OF TROOPS STANDING MOTIONLESS AS IF TURNED TO STONE 
HUNDREDS OF RIDERS COMPOSING THE SUITES MOVED CARELESSLY 
BUT SYMMETRICALLY AND ABOVE ALL FREELY AND IN FRONT OF THEM 
TWO MENTHE EMPERORS UPON THEM THE UNDIVIDED TENSELY 
PASSIONATE ATTENTION OF THAT WHOLE MASS OF MEN WAS CONCEN 
TRATED
THE HANDSOME YOUNG EMPEROR ALEXANDER IN THE UNI 
FORM OF THE HORSE GUARDS WEARING A COCKED HAT WITH ITS 
PEAKS FRONT AND BACK WITH HIS PLEASANT FACE AND RESONANT 
THOUGH NOT LOUD VOICE ATTRACTED EVERYONES ATTENTION
ROSTOV WAS NOT FAR FROM THE TRUMPETERS AND WITH HIS 
KEEN SIGHT HAD RECOGNIZED THE TSAR AND WATCHED HIS AP 
PROACH WHEN HE WAS WITHIN TWENTY PACES AND NICHOLAS 
COULD CLEARLY DISTINGUISH EVERY DETAIL OF HIS HANDSOME 
HAPPY YOUNG FACE HE EXPERIENCED A FEELING TENDERNESS AND 
ECSTASY SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN EVERY TRAIT AND 
EVERY MOVEMENT OF THE TSARS SEEMED TO HIM ENCHANTING
STOPPING IN FRONT OF THE PAVLOGRADS THE TSAR SAID SOME 
THING IN FRENCH TO THE AUSTRIAN EMPEROR AND SMILED
SEEING THAT SMILE ROSTOV INVOLUNTARILY SMILED HIMSELF 
AND FELT A STILL STRONGER FLOW OF LOVE FOR HIS SOVEREIGN HE 
LONGED TO SHOW THAT LOVE IN SOME WAY AND KNOWING THAT THIS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWAS IMPOSSIBLE WAS READY TO CRY THE TSAR CALLED THE COLONEL 
OF THE REGIMENT AND SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM
OH GOD WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME IF THE EMPEROR SPOKE 
TO ME THOUGHT ROSTOV I SHOULD DIE OF HAPPINESS
THE TSAR ADDRESSED THE OFFICERS ALSO I THANK YOU ALL GEN 
TLEMEN I THANK YOU WITH MY WHOLE HEART TO ROSTOV EVERY 
WORD SOUNDED LIKE A VOICE FROM HEAVEN HOW GLADLY WOULD 
HE HAVE DIED AT ONCE FOR HIS TSAR
YOU HAVE EARNED THE ST GEORGES STANDARDS AND WILL BE 
WORTHY OF THEM
OH TO DIE TO DIE FOR HIM  THOUGHT ROSTOV
THE TSAR SAID SOMETHING MORE WHICH ROSTOV DID NOT HEAR 
AND THE SOLDIERS STRAINING THEIR LUNGS SHOUTED HURRAH
ROSTOV TOO BENDING OVER HIS SADDLE SHOUTED HURRAH 
WITH ALL HIS MIGHT FEELING THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO INJURE HIM 
SELF BY THAT SHOUT IF ONLY TO EXPRESS HIS RAPTURE FULLY
THE TSAR STOPPED A FEW MINUTES IN FRONT OF THE HUSSARS AS 
IF UNDECIDED
HOW CAN THE EMPEROR BE UNDECIDED THOUGHT ROSTOV 
BUT THEN EVEN THIS INDECISION APPEARED TO HIM MAJESTIC AND 
ENCHANTING LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE TSAR DID
THAT HESITATION LASTED ONLY AN INSTANT THE TSARS FOOT 
IN THE NARROW POINTED BOOT THEN FASHIONABLE TOUCHED THE 
GROIN OF THE BOBTAILED BAY MARE HE RODE HIS HAND IN A WHITE 
GLOVE GATHERED UP THE REINS AND HE MOVED OFF ACCOMPANIED 
BY AN IRREGULARLY SWAYING SEA OF AIDESDECAMP FARTHER AND 
FARTHER HE RODE AWAY STOPPING AT OTHER REGIMENTS TILL AT LAST 
ONLY HIS WHITE PLUMES WERE VISIBLE TO ROSTOV FROM AMID THE 
SUITES THAT SURROUNDED THE EMPERORSWAR AND PEACE AMONG THE GENTLEMEN OF THE SUITE ROSTOV NOTICED 
BOLKONSKI SITTING HIS HORSE INDOLENTLY AND CARELESSLY ROS 
TOV RECALLED THEIR QUARREL OF YESTERDAY AND THE QUESTION 
PRESENTED ITSELF WHETHER HE OUGHT OR OUGHT NOT TO CHALLENGE 
BOLKONSKI OF COURSE NOT HE NOW THOUGHT IS IT WORTH 
THINKING OR SPEAKING OF IT AT SUCH A MOMENT AT A TIME OF 
SUCH LOVE SUCH RAPTURE AND SUCH SELFSACRIFICE WHAT DO ANY 
OF OUR QUARRELS AND AFFRONTS MATTER I LOVE AND FORGIVE EV 
ERYBODY NOW
WHEN THE EMPEROR HAD PASSED NEARLY ALL THE REGIMENTS 
THE TROOPS BEGAN A CEREMONIAL MARCH PAST HIM AND ROS 
TOV ON BEDOUIN RECENTLY PURCHASED FROM DENISOV RODE PAST 
TOO AT THE REAR OF HIS SQUADRONTHAT IS ALONE AND IN FULL VIEW 
OF THE EMPEROR
BEFORE HE REACHED HIM ROSTOV WHO WAS A SPLENDID HORSE 
MAN SPURRED BEDOUIN TWICE AND SUCCESSFULLY PUT HIM TO THE 
SHOWY TROT IN WHICH THE ANIMAL WENT WHEN EXCITED BENDING 
HIS FOAMING MUZZLE TO HIS CHEST HIS TAIL EXTENDED BEDOUIN 
AS IF ALSO CONSCIOUS OF THE EMPERORS EYE UPON HIM PASSED 
SPLENDIDLY LIFTING HIS FEET WITH A HIGH AND GRACEFUL ACTION AS 
IF FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GROUND
ROSTOV HIMSELF HIS LEGS WELL BACK AND HIS STOMACH DRAWN 
IN AND FEELING HIMSELF ONE WITH HIS HORSE RODE PAST THE EM 
PEROR WITH A FROWNING BUT BLISSFUL FACE LIKE A VEWY DEVIL AS 
DENISOV EXPRESSED IT
FINE FELLOWS THE PAVLOGRADS REMARKED THE EMPEROR
MY GOD HOW HAPPY I SHOULD BE IF HE ORDERED ME TO LEAP 
INTO THE FIRE THIS INSTANT THOUGHT ROSTOV
WHEN THE REVIEW WAS OVER THE NEWLY ARRIVED OFFICERS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMAND ALSO KUTUZOVS COLLECTED IN GROUPS AND BEGAN TO TALK 
ABOUT THE AWARDS ABOUT THE AUSTRIANS AND THEIR UNIFORMS 
ABOUT THEIR LINES ABOUT BONAPARTE AND HOW BADLY THE LAT 
TER WOULD FARE NOW ESPECIALLY IF THE ESSEN CORPS ARRIVED AND 
PRUSSIA TOOK OUR SIDE
BUT THE TALK IN EVERY GROUP WAS CHIEFLY ABOUT THE EMPER 
OR ALEXANDER HIS EVERY WORD AND MOVEMENT WAS DESCRIBED 
WITH ECSTASY
THEY ALL HAD BUT ONE WISH TO ADVANCE AS SOON AS POS 
SIBLE AGAINST THE ENEMY UNDER THE EMPERORS COMMAND 
COMMANDED BY THE EMPEROR HIMSELF THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO 
VANQUISH ANYONE BE IT WHOM IT MIGHT SO THOUGHT ROSTOV 
AND MOST OF THE OFFICERS AFTER THE REVIEW
ALL WERE THEN MORE CONFIDENT OF VICTORY THAN THE WIN 
NING OF TWO BATTLES WOULD HAVE MADE THEMWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER IX
THE DAY AFTER THE REVIEW BORIS IN HIS BEST UNIFORM AND 
WITH HIS COMRADE BERGS BEST WISHES FOR SUCCESS RODE TO OL 
MUTZ TO SEE BOLKONSKI WISHING TO PROFIT BY HIS FRIENDLINESS 
AND OBTAIN FOR HIMSELF THE BEST POST HE COULDPREFERABLY THAT 
OF ADJUTANT TO SOME IMPORTANT PERSONAGE A POSITION IN THE 
ARMY WHICH SEEMED TO HIM MOST ATTRACTIVE IT IS ALL VERY 
WELL FOR ROSTOV WHOSE FATHER SENDS HIM TEN THOUSAND RUBLES 
AT A TIME TO TALK ABOUT NOT WISHING TO CRINGE TO ANYBODY 
AND NOT BE ANYONES LACKEY BUT I WHO HAVE NOTHING BUT MY 
BRAINS HAVE TO MAKE A CAREER AND MUST NOT MISS OPPORTUNI 
TIES BUT MUST AVAIL MYSELF OF THEM HE REFLECTED
HE DID NOT FIND PRINCE ANDREW IN OLMUTZ THAT DAY BUT 
THE APPEARANCE OF THE TOWN WHERE THE HEADQUARTERS AND 
THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS WERE STATIONED AND THE TWO EMPERORS 
WERE LIVING WITH THEIR SUITES HOUSEHOLDS AND COURTS ONLY 
STRENGTHENED HIS DESIRE TO BELONG TO THAT HIGHER WORLD
HE KNEW NO ONE AND DESPITE HIS SMART GUARDSMANS 
UNIFORM ALL THESE EXALTED PERSONAGES PASSING IN THE STREETS 
IN THEIR ELEGANT CARRIAGES WITH THEIR PLUMES RIBBONS AND 
MEDALS BOTH COURTIERS AND MILITARY MEN SEEMED SO IM 
MEASURABLY ABOVE HIM AN INSIGNIFICANT OFFICER OF THE 
GUARDS THAT THEY NOT ONLY DID NOT WISH TO BUT SIMPLY COULD 
NOT BE AWARE OF HIS EXISTENCE AT THE QUARTERS OF THE COM 
MANDER IN CHIEF KUTUZOV WHERE HE INQUIRED FOR BOLKONSKI  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMALL THE ADJUTANTS AND EVEN THE ORDERLIES LOOKED AT HIM AS IF 
THEY WISHED TO IMPRESS ON HIM THAT A GREAT MANY OFFICERS 
LIKE HIM WERE ALWAYS COMING THERE AND THAT EVERYBODY WAS 
HEARTILY SICK OF THEM IN SPITE OF THIS OR RATHER BECAUSE OF IT 
NEXT DAY NOVEMBER  AFTER DINNER HE AGAIN WENT TO OL 
MUTZ AND ENTERING THE HOUSE OCCUPIED BY KUTUZOV ASKED 
FOR BOLKONSKI PRINCE ANDREW WAS IN AND BORIS WAS SHOWN 
INTO A LARGE HALL PROBABLY FORMERLY USED FOR DANCING BUT IN

GO THROUGH THE DOOR ON THE LEFT INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM IF 
HE WISHED TO SEE HIM BORIS THANKED HIM AND WENT TO THE 
RECEPTION ROOM WHERE HE FOUND SOME TEN OFFICERS AND GEN 
ERALS
WHEN HE ENTERED PRINCE ANDREW HIS EYES DROOPING 
CONTEMPTUOUSLY WITH THAT PECULIAR EXPRESSION OF POLITE 
WEARINESS WHICH PLAINLY SAYS IF IT WERE NOT MY DUTY I WOULD 
NOT TALK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT WAS LISTENING TO AN OLD RUS

OUSLY AND NOTICING BORIS PRINCE ANDREW PAYING NO MORE 
HEED TO THE GENERAL WHO RAN AFTER HIM IMPLORING HIM TO 
HEAR SOMETHING MORE NODDED AND TURNED TO HIM WITH A 
CHEERFUL SMILE
AT THAT MOMENT BORIS CLEARLY REALIZED WHAT HE HAD BE 
FORE SURMISED THAT IN THE ARMY BESIDES THE SUBORDINATION 
AND DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED IN THE MILITARY CODE WHICH HE AND 
THE OTHERS KNEW IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS ANOTHER MORE 
IMPORTANT SUBORDINATION WHICH MADE THIS TIGHTLACED 
PURPLEFACED GENERAL WAIT RESPECTFULLY WHILE CAPTAIN PRINCE 
ANDREW FOR HIS OWN PLEASURE CHOSE TO CHAT WITH LIEUTEN 
ANT DRUBETSKOY MORE THAN EVER WAS BORIS RESOLVED TO SERVE 
IN FUTURE NOT ACCORDING TO THE WRITTEN CODE BUT UNDER THIS 
UNWRITTEN LAW HE FELT NOW THAT MERELY BY HAVING BEEN REC 
OMMENDED TO PRINCE ANDREW HE HAD ALREADY RISEN ABOVE 
THE GENERAL WHO AT THE FRONT HAD THE POWER TO ANNIHILATE 
HIM A LIEUTENANT OF THE GUARDS PRINCE ANDREW CAME UP TO 
HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND
I AM VERY SORRY YOU DID NOT FIND ME IN YESTERDAY I WAS 
FUSSING ABOUT WITH GERMANS ALL DAY WE WENT WITH WEY 
ROTHER TO SURVEY THE DISPOSITIONS WHEN GERMANS START

FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD WEYROTHERS NAME OR EVEN THE TERM  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMDISPOSITIONS
WELL MY DEAR FELLOW SO YOU STILL WANT TO BE AN ADJUTANT

WHILE PRINCE ANDREW WENT TO REPORT ABOUT THE PURPLE
FACED GENERAL THAT GENTLEMANEVIDENTLY NOT SHARING BORIS 
CONCEPTION OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE UNWRITTEN CODE OF SUB 
ORDINATIONLOOKED SO FIXEDLY AT THE PRESUMPTUOUS LIEUTENANT 
WHO HAD PREVENTED HIS FINISHING WHAT HE HAD TO SAY TO THE 
ADJUTANT THAT BORIS FELT UNCOMFORTABLE HE TURNED AWAY AND 
WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR PRINCE ANDREWS RETURN FROM THE 
COMMANDER IN CHIEFS ROOM
YOU SEE MY DEAR FELLOW I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU 
SAID PRINCE ANDREW WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE LARGE ROOM 
WHERE THE CLAVICHORD WAS ITS NO USE YOUR GOING TO THE COM 
MANDER IN CHIEF HE WOULD SAY A LOT OF PLEASANT THINGS ASK 
YOU TO DINNER THAT WOULD NOT BE BAD AS REGARDS THE UN 
WRITTEN CODE THOUGHT BORIS BUT NOTHING MORE WOULD 
COME OF IT THERE WILL SOON BE A BATTALION OF US AIDESDE
CAMP AND ADJUTANTS BUT THIS IS WHAT WELL DO I HAVE A GOOD 
FRIEND AN ADJUTANT GENERAL AND AN EXCELLENT FELLOW PRINCE 
DOLGORUKOV AND THOUGH YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT THE FACT IS WAR AND PEACE THAT NOW KUTUZOV WITH HIS STAFF AND ALL OF US COUNT FOR NOTH 
ING EVERYTHING IS NOW CENTERED ROUND THE EMPEROR SO WE 
WILL GO TO DOLGORUKOV I HAVE TO GO THERE ANYHOW AND I HAVE 
ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT YOU WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HE 
CANNOT ATTACH YOU TO HIMSELF OR FIND A PLACE FOR YOU SOME 
WHERE NEARER THE SUN
PRINCE ANDREW ALWAYS BECAME SPECIALLY KEEN WHEN HE 
HAD TO GUIDE A YOUNG MAN AND HELP HIM TO WORLDLY SUC 
CESS UNDER COVER OF OBTAINING HELP OF THIS KIND FOR ANOTHER 
WHICH FROM PRIDE HE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT FOR HIMSELF HE KEPT 
IN TOUCH WITH THE CIRCLE WHICH CONFERS SUCCESS AND WHICH AT 
TRACTED HIM HE VERY READILY TOOK UP BORIS CAUSE AND WENT 
WITH HIM TO DOLGORUKOV
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY ENTERED THE PALACE AT 
OLMUTZ OCCUPIED BY THE EMPERORS AND THEIR RETINUES
THAT SAME DAY A COUNCIL OF WAR HAD BEEN HELD IN WHICH 
ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE HOFKRIEGSRATH AND BOTH EMPER 
ORS TOOK PART AT THAT COUNCIL CONTRARY TO THE VIEWS OF THE 
OLD GENERALS KUTUZOV AND PRINCE SCHWARTZENBERG IT HAD 
BEEN DECIDED TO ADVANCE IMMEDIATELY AND GIVE BATTLE TO 
BONAPARTE THE COUNCIL OF WAR WAS JUST OVER WHEN PRINCE 
ANDREW ACCOMPANIED BY BORIS ARRIVED AT THE PALACE TO FIND 
DOLGORUKOV EVERYONE AT HEADQUARTERS WAS STILL UNDER THE 
SPELL OF THE DAYS COUNCIL AT WHICH THE PARTY OF THE YOUNG 
HAD TRIUMPHED THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO COUNSELED DELAY 
AND ADVISED WAITING FOR SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE ADVANC 
ING HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY SILENCED AND THEIR ARGUMENTS 
CONFUTED BY SUCH CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF 
ATTACKING THAT WHAT HAD BEEN DISCUSSED AT THE COUNCILTHE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCOMING BATTLE AND THE VICTORY THAT WOULD CERTAINLY RESULT 
FROM ITNO LONGER SEEMED TO BE IN THE FUTURE BUT IN THE PAST 
ALL THE ADVANTAGES WERE ON OUR SIDE OUR ENORMOUS FORC 
ES UNDOUBTEDLY SUPERIOR TO NAPOLEONS WERE CONCENTRATED 
IN ONE PLACE THE TROOPS INSPIRED BY THE EMPERORS PRESENCE 
WERE EAGER FOR ACTION THE STRATEGIC POSITION WHERE THE OPER 
ATIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE WAS FAMILIAR IN ALL ITS DETAILS TO THE 
AUSTRIAN GENERAL WEYROTHER A LUCKY ACCIDENT HAD ORDAINED 
THAT THE AUSTRIAN ARMY SHOULD MANEUVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR 
ON THE VERY FIELDS WHERE THE FRENCH HAD NOW TO BE FOUGHT 
THE ADJACENT LOCALITY WAS KNOWN AND SHOWN IN EVERY DETAIL 
ON THE MAPS AND BONAPARTE EVIDENTLY WEAKENED WAS UN 
DERTAKING NOTHING
DOLGORUKOV ONE OF THE WARMEST ADVOCATES OF AN ATTACK 
HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE COUNCIL TIRED AND EXHAUSTED BUT 
EAGER AND PROUD OF THE VICTORY THAT HAD BEEN GAINED PRINCE 
ANDREW INTRODUCED HIS PROTEGE BUT PRINCE DOLGORUKOV PO 
LITELY AND FIRMLY PRESSING HIS HAND SAID NOTHING TO BORIS 
AND EVIDENTLY UNABLE TO SUPPRESS THE THOUGHTS WHICH WERE 
UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND AT THAT MOMENT ADDRESSED PRINCE 
ANDREW IN FRENCH
AH MY DEAR FELLOW WHAT A BATTLE WE HAVE GAINED GOD 
GRANT THAT THE ONE THAT WILL RESULT FROM IT WILL BE AS VICTORI 
OUS HOWEVER DEAR FELLOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY AND EAGERLY I 
MUST CONFESS TO HAVING BEEN UNJUST TO THE AUSTRIANS AND ES 
PECIALLY TO WEYROTHER WHAT EXACTITUDE WHAT MINUTENESS 
WHAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY WHAT FORESIGHT FOR EVERY 
EVENTUALITY EVERY POSSIBILITY EVEN TO THE SMALLEST DETAIL NO 
MY DEAR FELLOW NO CONDITIONS BETTER THAN OUR PRESENT ONES WAR AND PEACE COULD HAVE BEEN DEVISED THIS COMBINATION OF AUSTRIAN PRE 
CISION WITH RUSSIAN VALORWHAT MORE COULD BE WISHED FOR
SO THE ATTACK IS DEFINITELY RESOLVED ON ASKED BOLKON 
SKI
AND DO YOU KNOW MY DEAR FELLOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT 
BONAPARTE HAS DECIDEDLY LOST BEARINGS YOU KNOW THAT A 
LETTER WAS RECEIVED FROM HIM TODAY FOR THE EMPEROR DOLGO 
RUKOV SMILED SIGNIFICANTLY
IS THAT SO AND WHAT DID HE SAY INQUIRED BOLKONSKI
WHAT CAN HE SAY TRADIRIDIRA AND SO ON MERELY TO 
GAIN TIME I TELL YOU HE IS IN OUR HANDS THATS CERTAIN BUT 
WHAT WAS MOST AMUSING HE CONTINUED WITH A SUDDEN GOOD
NATURED LAUGH WAS THAT WE COULD NOT THINK HOW TO ADDRESS 
THE REPLY IF NOT AS CONSUL AND OF COURSE NOT AS EMPEROR IT 
SEEMED TO ME IT SHOULD BE TO GENERAL BONAPARTE
BUT BETWEEN NOT RECOGNIZING HIM AS EMPEROR AND CALL 
ING HIM GENERAL BONAPARTE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE REMARKED 
BOLKONSKI
THATS JUST IT INTERRUPTED DOLGORUKOV QUICKLY LAUGHING 
YOU KNOW BILIBINHES A VERY CLEVER FELLOW HE SUGGESTED AD 
DRESSING HIM AS USURPER AND ENEMY OF MANKIND
DOLGORUKOV LAUGHED MERRILY
ONLY THAT SAID BOLKONSKI
ALL THE SAME IT WAS BILIBIN WHO FOUND A SUITABLE FORM FOR 
THE ADDRESS HE IS A WISE AND CLEVER FELLOW
WHAT WAS IT
TO THE HEAD OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AU CHEF DU 
GOUVERNEMENT FRANCAIS SAID DOLGORUKOV WITH GRAVE SATIS 
FACTION GOOD WASNT IT FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMYES BUT HE WILL DISLIKE IT EXTREMELY SAID BOLKONSKI
OH YES VERY MUCH MY BROTHER KNOWS HIM HES DINED 
WITH HIMTHE PRESENT EMPERORMORE THAN ONCE IN PARIS 
AND TELLS ME HE NEVER MET A MORE CUNNING OR SUBTLE DIPLO 
MATISTYOU KNOW A COMBINATION OF FRENCH ADROITNESS AND 
ITALIAN PLAYACTING DO YOU KNOW THE TALE ABOUT HIM AND 
COUNT MARKOV COUNT MARKOV WAS THE ONLY MAN WHO KNEW 
HOW TO HANDLE HIM YOU KNOW THE STORY OF THE HANDKER 
CHIEF IT IS DELIGHTFUL
AND THE TALKATIVE DOLGORUKOV TURNING NOW TO BORIS 
NOW TO PRINCE ANDREW TOLD HOW BONAPARTE WISHING TO TEST 
MARKOV OUR AMBASSADOR PURPOSELY DROPPED A HANDKER 
CHIEF IN FRONT OF HIM AND STOOD LOOKING AT MARKOV PROBABLY 
EXPECTING MARKOV TO PICK IT UP FOR HIM AND HOW MARKOV 
IMMEDIATELY DROPPED HIS OWN BESIDE IT AND PICKED IT UP 
WITHOUT TOUCHING BONAPARTES
DELIGHTFUL SAID BOLKONSKI BUT I HAVE COME TO YOU 
PRINCE AS A PETITIONER ON BEHALF OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU 
SEE BUT BEFORE PRINCE ANDREW COULD FINISH AN AIDEDE
CAMP CAME IN TO SUMMON DOLGORUKOV TO THE EMPEROR
OH WHAT A NUISANCE SAID DOLGORUKOV GETTING UP HUR 
RIEDLY AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF PRINCE ANDREW AND BORIS 
YOU KNOW I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO DO ALL IN MY POWER BOTH 
FOR YOU AND FOR THIS DEAR YOUNG MAN AGAIN HE PRESSED THE 
HAND OF THE LATTER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF GOODNATURED SIN 
CERE AND ANIMATED LEVITY BUT YOU SEE ANOTHER TIME
BORIS WAS EXCITED BY THE THOUGHT OF BEING SO CLOSE TO THE 
HIGHER POWERS AS HE FELT HIMSELF TO BE AT THAT MOMENT HE 
WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HERE HE WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE SPRINGS WAR AND PEACE THAT SET IN MOTION THE ENORMOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE MASS OF 
WHICH IN HIS REGIMENT HE FELT HIMSELF A TINY OBEDIENT AND 
INSIGNIFICANT ATOM THEY FOLLOWED PRINCE DOLGORUKOV OUT 
INTO THE CORRIDOR AND METCOMING OUT OF THE DOOR OF THE EM 
PERORS ROOM BY WHICH DOLGORUKOV HAD ENTEREDA SHORT MAN 
IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES WITH A CLEVER FACE AND SHARPLY PROJECTING 
JAW WHICH WITHOUT SPOILING HIS FACE GAVE HIM A PECULIAR 
VIVACITY AND SHIFTINESS OF EXPRESSION THIS SHORT MAN NOD 
DED TO DOLGORUKOV AS TO AN INTIMATE FRIEND AND STARED AT 
PRINCE ANDREW WITH COOL INTENSITY WALKING STRAIGHT TOWARD 
HIM AND EVIDENTLY EXPECTING HIM TO BOW OR TO STEP OUT OF 
HIS WAY PRINCE ANDREW DID NEITHER A LOOK OF ANIMOSITY 
APPEARED ON HIS FACE AND THE OTHER TURNED AWAY AND WENT 
DOWN THE SIDE OF THE CORRIDOR
WHO WAS THAT ASKED BORIS
HE IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE BUT TO ME MOST UN 
PLEASANT OF MENTHE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS PRINCE 
ADAM CZARTORYSKI IT IS SUCH MEN AS HE WHO DECIDE THE 
FATE OF NATIONS ADDED BOLKONSKI WITH A SIGH HE COULD NOT 
SUPPRESS AS THEY PASSED OUT OF THE PALACE

ALL BEGAN TO RUN AND BUSTLE AND ROSTOV SAW COMING UP 
THE ROAD BEHIND HIM SEVERAL RIDERS WITH WHITE PLUMES IN 
THEIR HATS IN A MOMENT EVERYONE WAS IN HIS PLACE WAITING
ROSTOV DID NOT KNOW OR REMEMBER HOW HE RAN TO HIS 
PLACE AND MOUNTED INSTANTLY HIS REGRET AT NOT HAVING BEEN 
IN ACTION AND HIS DEJECTED MOOD AMID PEOPLE OF WHOM HE 
WAS WEARY HAD GONE INSTANTLY EVERY THOUGHT OF HIMSELF HAD 
VANISHED HE WAS FILLED WITH HAPPINESS AT HIS NEARNESS TO 
THE EMPEROR HE FELT THAT THIS NEARNESS BY ITSELF MADE UP TO 
HIM FOR THE DAY HE HAD LOST HE WAS HAPPY AS A LOVER WHEN WAR AND PEACE THE LONGEDFOR MOMENT OF MEETING ARRIVES NOT DARING TO 
LOOK ROUND AND WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND HE WAS ECSTATICALLY 
CONSCIOUS OF HIS APPROACH HE FELT IT NOT ONLY FROM THE SOUND 
OF THE HOOFS OF THE APPROACHING CAVALCADE BUT BECAUSE AS HE 
DREW NEAR EVERYTHING GREW BRIGHTER MORE JOYFUL MORE SIG 
NIFICANT AND MORE FESTIVE AROUND HIM NEARER AND NEARER TO 
ROSTOV CAME THAT SUN SHEDDING BEAMS OF MILD AND MAJESTIC 
LIGHT AROUND AND ALREADY HE FELT HIMSELF ENVELOPED IN THOSE 
BEAMS HE HEARD HIS VOICE THAT KINDLY CALM AND MAJESTIC 
VOICE THAT WAS YET SO SIMPLE AND AS IF IN ACCORD WITH ROS 
TOVS FEELING THERE WAS A DEATHLY STILLNESS AMID WHICH WAS 
HEARD THE EMPERORS VOICE
THE PAVLOGRAD HUSSARS HE INQUIRED
THE RESERVES SIRE REPLIED A VOICE A VERY HUMAN ONE 
COMPARED TO THAT WHICH HAD SAID THE PAVLOGRAD HUSSARS

THREE DAYS BEFORE AT THE REVIEW IT SHONE WITH SUCH GAIETY 
AND YOUTH SUCH INNOCENT YOUTH THAT IT SUGGESTED THE LIVELI 
NESS OF A FOURTEENYEAROLD BOY AND YET IT WAS THE FACE OF THE 
MAJESTIC EMPEROR CASUALLY WHILE SURVEYING THE SQUADRON 
THE EMPERORS EYES MET ROSTOVS AND RESTED ON THEM FOR NOT 
MORE THAN TWO SECONDS WHETHER OR NO THE EMPEROR UN 
DERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON IN ROSTOVS SOUL IT SEEMED TO 
ROSTOV THAT HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING AT ANY RATE HIS LIGHT
BLUE EYES GAZED FOR ABOUT TWO SECONDS INTO ROSTOVS FACE 
A GENTLE MILD LIGHT POURED FROM THEM THEN ALL AT ONCE HE 
RAISED HIS EYEBROWS ABRUPTLY TOUCHED HIS HORSE WITH HIS LEFT 
FOOT AND GALLOPED ON FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMTHE YOUNGER EMPEROR COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS WISH TO BE 
PRESENT AT THE BATTLE AND IN SPITE OF THE REMONSTRANCES OF HIS 
COURTIERS AT TWELVE OCLOCK LEFT THE THIRD COLUMN WITH WHICH 
HE HAD BEEN AND GALLOPED TOWARD THE VANGUARD BEFORE HE 
CAME UP WITH THE HUSSARS SEVERAL ADJUTANTS MET HIM WITH 
NEWS OF THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT OF THE ACTION
THIS BATTLE WHICH CONSISTED IN THE CAPTURE OF A FRENCH 
SQUADRON WAS REPRESENTED AS A BRILLIANT VICTORY OVER THE 
FRENCH AND SO THE EMPEROR AND THE WHOLE ARMY ESPECIALLY 
WHILE THE SMOKE HUNG OVER THE BATTLEFIELD BELIEVED THAT THE 
FRENCH HAD BEEN DEFEATED AND WERE RETREATING AGAINST THEIR 
WILL A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE EMPEROR HAD PASSED THE PAV 
LOGRAD DIVISION WAS ORDERED TO ADVANCE IN WISCHAU ITSELF A 
PETTY GERMAN TOWN ROSTOV SAW THE EMPEROR AGAIN IN THE 
MARKET PLACE WHERE THERE HAD BEEN SOME RATHER HEAVY FIRING 
BEFORE THE EMPERORS ARRIVAL LAY SEVERAL KILLED AND WOUNDED 
SOLDIERS WHOM THERE HAD NOT BEEN TIME TO MOVE THE EM 
PEROR SURROUNDED BY HIS SUITE OF OFFICERS AND COURTIERS WAS 
RIDING A BOBTAILED CHESTNUT MARE A DIFFERENT ONE FROM THAT 
WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN AT THE REVIEW AND BENDING TO ONE SIDE 
HE GRACEFULLY HELD A GOLD LORGNETTE TO HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT 
A SOLDIER WHO LAY PRONE WITH BLOOD ON HIS UNCOVERED HEAD 
THE WOUNDED SOLDIER WAS SO DIRTY COARSE AND REVOLTING THAT 
HIS PROXIMITY TO THE EMPEROR SHOCKED ROSTOV ROSTOV SAW 
HOW THE EMPERORS RATHER ROUND SHOULDERS SHUDDERED AS IF 
A COLD SHIVER HAD RUN DOWN THEM HOW HIS LEFT FOOT BEGAN 
CONVULSIVELY TAPPING THE HORSES SIDE WITH THE SPUR AND HOW 
THE WELLTRAINED HORSE LOOKED ROUND UNCONCERNED AND DID

THE NEXT DAY THE EMPEROR STOPPED AT WISCHAU AND VIL 
LIER HIS PHYSICIAN WAS REPEATEDLY SUMMONED TO SEE HIM AT 
HEADQUARTERS AND AMONG THE TROOPS NEAR BY THE NEWS SPREAD 
THAT THE EMPEROR WAS UNWELL HE ATE NOTHING AND HAD SLEPT 
BADLY THAT NIGHT THOSE AROUND HIM REPORTED THE CAUSE OF 
THIS INDISPOSITION WAS THE STRONG IMPRESSION MADE ON HIS 
SENSITIVE MIND BY THE SIGHT OF THE KILLED AND WOUNDED
AT DAYBREAK ON THE SEVENTEENTH A FRENCH OFFICER WHO 
HAD COME WITH A FLAG OF TRUCE DEMANDING AN AUDIENCE WITH 
THE RUSSIAN EMPEROR WAS BROUGHT INTO WISCHAU FROM OUR 
OUTPOSTS THIS OFFICER WAS SAVARY THE EMPEROR HAD ONLY 
JUST FALLEN ASLEEP AND SO SAVARY HAD TO WAIT AT MIDDAY HE 
WAS ADMITTED TO THE EMPEROR AND AN HOUR LATER HE RODE OFF  
WITH PRINCE DOLGORUKOV TO THE ADVANCED POST OF THE FRENCH 
ARMY
IT WAS RUMORED THAT SAVARY HAD BEEN SENT TO PROPOSE TO 
ALEXANDER A MEETING WITH NAPOLEON TO THE JOY AND PRIDE 
OF THE WHOLE ARMY A PERSONAL INTERVIEW WAS REFUSED AND 
INSTEAD OF THE SOVEREIGN PRINCE DOLGORUKOV THE VICTOR AT 
WISCHAU WAS SENT WITH SAVARY TO NEGOTIATE WITH NAPOLEON 
IF CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS THESE NEGOTIATIONS WERE ACTU 
ATED BY A REAL DESIRE FOR PEACE
TOWARD EVENING DOLGORUKOV CAME BACK WENT STRAIGHT TO 
THE TSAR AND REMAINED ALONE WITH HIM FOR A LONG TIMEWAR AND PEACE ON THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER THE 
ARMY ADVANCED TWO DAYS MARCH AND THE ENEMYS OUTPOSTS 
AFTER A BRIEF INTERCHANGE OF SHOTS RETREATED IN THE HIGHEST 
ARMY CIRCLES FROM MIDDAY ON THE NINETEENTH A GREAT EXCIT

WAS FOUGHT
TILL MIDDAY ON THE NINETEENTH THE ACTIVITYTHE EAGER TALK 
RUNNING TO AND FRO AND DISPATCHING OF ADJUTANTSWAS CON 
FINED TO THE EMPERORS HEADQUARTERS BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF 
THAT DAY THIS ACTIVITY REACHED KUTIIZOVS HEADQUARTERS AND 
THE STAFFS OF THE COMMANDERS OF COLUMNS BY EVENING THE 
ADJUTANTS HAD SPREAD IT TO ALL ENDS AND PARTS OF THE ARMY AND 
IN THE NIGHT FROM THE NINETEENTH TO THE TWENTIETH THE WHOLE 
EIGHTY THOUSAND ALLIED TROOPS ROSE FROM THEIR BIVOUACS TO 
THE HUM OF VOICES AND THE ARMY SWAYED AND STARTED IN ONE 
ENORMOUS MASS SIX MILES LONG
THE CONCENTRATED ACTIVITY WHICH HAD BEGUN AT THE EM 
PERORS HEADQUARTERS IN THE MORNING AND HAD STARTED THE 
WHOLE MOVEMENT THAT FOLLOWED WAS LIKE THE FIRST MOVEMENT 
OF THE MAIN WHEEL OF A LARGE TOWER CLOCK ONE WHEEL SLOWLY 
MOVED ANOTHER WAS SET IN MOTION AND A THIRD AND WHEELS 
BEGAN TO REVOLVE FASTER AND FASTER LEVERS AND COGWHEELS TO 
WORK CHIMES TO PLAY FIGURES TO POP OUT AND THE HANDS TO 
ADVANCE WITH REGULAR MOTION AS A RESULT OF ALL THAT ACTIVITY
JUST AS IN THE MECHANISM OF A CLOCK SO IN THE MECHA 
NISM OF THE MILITARY MACHINE AN IMPULSE ONCE GIVEN LEADS

MOMENT WHEN MOTION IS TRANSMITTED TO THEM ARE THE PARTS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMOF THE MECHANISM WHICH THE IMPULSE HAS NOT YET REACHED

LESS AS THOUGH IT WERE PREPARED TO REMAIN SO FOR A HUNDRED 
YEARS BUT THE MOMENT COMES WHEN THE LEVER CATCHES IT AND 
OBEYING THE IMPULSE THAT WHEEL BEGINS TO CREAK AND JOINS 
IN THE COMMON MOTION THE RESULT AND AIM OF WHICH ARE BE 
YOND ITS KEN
JUST AS IN A CLOCK THE RESULT OF THE COMPLICATED MOTION OF 
INNUMERABLE WHEELS AND PULLEYS IS MERELY A SLOW AND REGULAR 
MOVEMENT OF THE HANDS WHICH SHOW THE TIME SO THE RESULT

THE LOSS OF THE BATTLE OF AUSTERLITZ THE SOCALLED BATTLE OF THE

ON THE DIAL OF HUMAN HISTORY
PRINCE ANDREW WAS ON DUTY THAT DAY AND IN CONSTANT AT 
TENDANCE ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
AT SIX IN THE EVENING KUTUZOV WENT TO THE EMPERORS 
HEADQUARTERS AND AFTER STAYING BUT A SHORT TIME WITH THE 
TSAR WENT TO SEE THE GRAND MARSHAL OF THE COURT COUNT TOL 
STOY
BOLKONSKI TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN TO GET SOME DE 
TAILS OF THE COMING ACTION FROM DOLGORUKOV HE FELT THAT 
KUTUZOV WAS UPSET AND DISSATISFIED ABOUT SOMETHING AND 
THAT AT HEADQUARTERS THEY WERE DISSATISFIED WITH HIM AND 
ALSO THAT AT THE EMPERORS HEADQUARTERS EVERYONE ADOPTED WAR AND PEACE TOWARD HIM THE TONE OF MEN WHO KNOW SOMETHING OTHERS DO 
NOT KNOW HE THEREFORE WISHED TO SPEAK TO DOLGORUKOV
WELL HOW DYOU DO MY DEAR FELLOW SAID DOLGORUKOV 
WHO WAS SITTING AT TEA WITH BILIBIN THE FETE IS FOR TOMORROW 
HOW IS YOUR OLD FELLOW OUT OF SORTS
I WONT SAY HE IS OUT OF SORTS BUT I FANCY HE WOULD LIKE 
TO BE HEARD
BUT THEY HEARD HIM AT THE COUNCIL OF WAR AND WILL HEAR 
HIM WHEN HE TALKS SENSE BUT TO TEMPORIZE AND WAIT FOR 
SOMETHING NOW WHEN BONAPARTE FEARS NOTHING SO MUCH AS A 
GENERAL BATTLE IS IMPOSSIBLE
YES YOU HAVE SEEN HIM SAID PRINCE ANDREW WELL 
WHAT IS BONAPARTE LIKE HOW DID HE IMPRESS YOU
YES I SAW HIM AND AM CONVINCED THAT HE FEARS NOTHING 
SO MUCH AS A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT REPEATED DOLGORUKOV 
EVIDENTLY PRIZING THIS GENERAL CONCLUSION WHICH HE HAD AR 
RIVED AT FROM HIS INTERVIEW WITH NAPOLEON IF HE WERENT 
AFRAID OF A BATTLE WHY DID HE ASK FOR THAT INTERVIEW WHY 
NEGOTIATE AND ABOVE ALL WHY RETREAT WHEN TO RETREAT IS SO 
CONTRARY TO HIS METHOD OF CONDUCTING WAR BELIEVE ME HE IS 
AFRAID AFRAID OF A GENERAL BATTLE HIS HOUR HAS COME MARK 
MY WORDS
BUT TELL ME WHAT IS HE LIKE EH SAID PRINCE ANDREW 
AGAIN
HE IS A MAN IN A GRAY OVERCOAT VERY ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD 
CALL HIM YOUR MAJESTY BUT WHO TO HIS CHAGRIN GOT NO TITLE 
FROM ME THATS THE SORT OF MAN HE IS AND NOTHING MORE RE 
PLIED DOLGORUKOV LOOKING ROUND AT BILIBIN WITH A SMILE
DESPITE MY GREAT RESPECT FOR OLD KUTUZOV HE CONTINUED  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWE SHOULD BE A NICE SET OF FELLOWS IF WE WERE TO WAIT ABOUT 
AND SO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO ESCAPE OR TO TRICK US NOW THAT 
WE CERTAINLY HAVE HIM IN OUR HANDS NO WE MUSTNT FORGET 
SUVOROV AND HIS RULENOT TO PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION TO BE 
ATTACKED BUT YOURSELF TO ATTACK BELIEVE ME IN WAR THE EN 
ERGY OF YOUNG MEN OFTEN SHOWS THE WAY BETTER THAN ALL THE 
EXPERIENCE OF OLD CUNCTATORS
BUT IN WHAT POSITION ARE WE GOING TO ATTACK HIM I HAVE 
BEEN AT THE OUTPOSTS TODAY AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHERE 
HIS CHIEF FORCES ARE SITUATED SAID PRINCE ANDREW
HE WISHED TO EXPLAIN TO DOLGORUKOV A PLAN OF ATTACK HE 
HAD HIMSELF FORMED
OH THAT IS ALL THE SAME DOLGORUKOV SAID QUICKLY AND 
GETTING UP HE SPREAD A MAP ON THE TABLE ALL EVENTUALITIES 
HAVE BEEN FORESEEN IF HE IS STANDING BEFORE BRUNN
AND PRINCE DOLGORUKOV RAPIDLY BUT INDISTINCTLY EX 
PLAINED WEYROTHERS PLAN OF A FLANKING MOVEMENT
PRINCE ANDREW BEGAN TO REPLY AND TO STATE HIS OWN PLAN 
WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS WEYROTHERS BUT FOR THE 
DISADVANTAGE THAT WEYROTHERS HAD ALREADY BEEN APPROVED 
AS SOON AS PRINCE ANDREW BEGAN TO DEMONSTRATE THE DEFECTS 
OF THE LATTER AND THE MERITS OF HIS OWN PLAN PRINCE DOLGORU 
KOV CEASED TO LISTEN TO HIM AND GAZED ABSENTMINDEDLY NOT 
AT THE MAP BUT AT PRINCE ANDREWS FACE
THERE WILL BE A COUNCIL OF WAR AT KUTUZOVS TONIGHT 
THOUGH YOU CAN SAY ALL THIS THERE REMARKED DOLGORUKOV
I WILL DO SO SAID PRINCE ANDREW MOVING AWAY FROM THE 
MAP
WHATEVER ARE YOU BOTHERING ABOUT GENTLEMEN SAID BIL WAR AND PEACE IBIN WHO TILL THEN HAD LISTENED WITH AN AMUSED SMILE TO 
THEIR CONVERSATION AND NOW WAS EVIDENTLY READY WITH A JOKE 
WHETHER TOMORROW BRINGS VICTORY OR DEFEAT THE GLORY OF OUR 
RUSSIAN ARMS IS SECURE EXCEPT YOUR KUTUZOV THERE IS NOT A 
SINGLE RUSSIAN IN COMMAND OF A COLUMN THE COMMAND 
ERS ARE HERR GENERAL WIMPFEN LE COMTE DE LANGERON LE 
PRINCE DE LICHTENSTEIN LE PRINCE DE HOHENLOHE AND FINALLY 
PRISHPRISH AND SO ON LIKE ALL THOSE POLISH NAMES
BE QUIET BACKBITER SAID DOLGORUKOV IT IS NOT TRUE 
THERE ARE NOW TWO RUSSIANS MILORADOVICH AND DOKHTUROV 
AND THERE WOULD BE A THIRD COUNT ARAKCHEEV IF HIS NERVES 
WERE NOT TOO WEAK
HOWEVER I THINK GENERAL KUTUZOV HAS COME OUT SAID 
PRINCE ANDREW I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK AND SUCCESS GEN 
TLEMEN HE ADDED AND WENT OUT AFTER SHAKING HANDS WITH 
DOLGORUKOV AND BILIBIN
ON THE WAY HOME PRINCE ANDREW COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM 
ASKING KUTUZOV WHO WAS SITTING SILENTLY BESIDE HIM WHAT 
HE THOUGHT OF TOMORROWS BATTLE
KUTUZOV LOOKED STERNLY AT HIS ADJUTANT AND AFTER A PAUSE 
REPLIED I THINK THE BATTLE WILL BE LOST AND SO I TOLD COUNT 
TOLSTOY AND ASKED HIM TO TELL THE EMPEROR WHAT DO YOU 
THINK HE REPLIED BUT MY DEAR GENERAL I AM ENGAGED WITH 
RICE AND CUTLETS LOOK AFTER MILITARY MATTERS YOURSELF YES 
THAT WAS THE ANSWER I GOT FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER XII
SHORTLY AFTER NINE OCLOCK THAT EVENING WEYROTHER DROVE 
WITH HIS PLANS TO KUTUZOVS QUARTERS WHERE THE COUNCIL OF 
WAR WAS TO BE HELD ALL THE COMMANDERS OF COLUMNS WERE 
SUMMONED TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEFS AND WITH THE EX 
CEPTION OF PRINCE BAGRATION WHO DECLINED TO COME WERE ALL 
THERE AT THE APPOINTED TIME
WEYROTHER WHO WAS IN FULL CONTROL OF THE PROPOSED BATTLE 
BY HIS EAGERNESS AND BRISKNESS PRESENTED A MARKED CONTRAST 
TO THE DISSATISFIED AND DROWSY KUTUZOV WHO RELUCTANTLY 
PLAYED THE PART OF CHAIRMAN AND PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF 
WAR WEYROTHER EVIDENTLY FELT HIMSELF TO BE AT THE HEAD OF A 
MOVEMENT THAT HAD ALREADY BECOME UNRESTRAINABLE HE WAS 
LIKE A HORSE RUNNING DOWNHILL HARNESSED TO A HEAVY CART 
WHETHER HE WAS PULLING IT OR BEING PUSHED BY IT HE DID NOT 
KNOW BUT RUSHED ALONG AT HEADLONG SPEED WITH NO TIME TO 
CONSIDER WHAT THIS MOVEMENT MIGHT LEAD TO WEYROTHER HAD 
BEEN TWICE THAT EVENING TO THE ENEMYS PICKET LINE TO RECON 
NOITER PERSONALLY AND TWICE TO THE EMPERORS RUSSIAN AND 
AUSTRIAN TO REPORT AND EXPLAIN AND TO HIS HEADQUARTERS 
WHERE HE HAD DICTATED THE DISPOSITIONS IN GERMAN AND NOW 
MUCH EXHAUSTED HE ARRIVED AT KUTUZOVS
HE WAS EVIDENTLY SO BUSY THAT HE EVEN FORGOT TO BE PO 
LITE TO THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE INTERRUPTED HIM TALKED 
RAPIDLY AND INDISTINCTLY WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE MAN HE WAS WAR AND PEACE ADDRESSING AND DID NOT REPLY TO QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM HE 
WAS BESPATTERED WITH MUD AND HAD A PITIFUL WEARY AND DIS 
TRACTED AIR THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS HAUGHTY AND 
SELFCONFIDENT
KUTUZOV WAS OCCUPYING A NOBLEMANS CASTLE OF MOD 
EST DIMENSIONS NEAR OSTRALITZ IN THE LARGE DRAWING ROOM 
WHICH HAD BECOME THE COMMANDER IN CHIEFS OFFICE WERE 
GATHERED KUTUZOV HIMSELF WEYROTHER AND THE MEMBERS OF 
THE COUNCIL OF WAR THEY WERE DRINKING TEA AND ONLY AWAIT 
ED PRINCE BAGRATION TO BEGIN THE COUNCIL AT LAST BAGRATIONS 
ORDERLY CAME WITH THE NEWS THAT THE PRINCE COULD NOT AT 
TEND PRINCE ANDREW CAME IN TO INFORM THE COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF OF THIS AND AVAILING HIMSELF OF PERMISSION PREVIOUSLY 
GIVEN HIM BY KUTUZOV TO BE PRESENT AT THE COUNCIL HE RE 
MAINED IN THE ROOM
SINCE PRINCE BAGRATION IS NOT COMING WE MAY BEGIN 
SAID WEYROTHER HURRIEDLY RISING FROM HIS SEAT AND GOING UP 
TO THE TABLE ON WHICH AN ENORMOUS MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF 
BRUNN WAS SPREAD OUT
KUTUZOV WITH HIS UNIFORM UNBUTTONED SO THAT HIS FAT 
NECK BULGED OVER HIS COLLAR AS IF ESCAPING WAS SITTING ALMOST 
ASLEEP IN A LOW CHAIR WITH HIS PODGY OLD HANDS RESTING SYM 
METRICALLY ON ITS ARMS AT THE SOUND OF WEYROTHERS VOICE 
HE OPENED HIS ONE EYE WITH AN EFFORT
YES YES IF YOU PLEASE IT IS ALREADY LATE SAID HE AND NOD 
DING HIS HEAD HE LET IT DROOP AND AGAIN CLOSED HIS EYE
IF AT FIRST THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THOUGHT THAT KU 
TUZOV WAS PRETENDING TO SLEEP THE SOUNDS HIS NOSE EMITTED 
DURING THE READING THAT FOLLOWED PROVED THAT THE COM  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMMANDER IN CHIEF AT THAT MOMENT WAS ABSORBED BY A FAR MORE 
SERIOUS MATTER THAN A DESIRE TO SHOW HIS CONTEMPT FOR THE 
DISPOSITIONS OR ANYTHING ELSEHE WAS ENGAGED IN SATISFYING

WEYROTHER WITH THE GESTURE OF A MAN TOO BUSY TO LOSE A MO

THAT HE WAS ASLEEP TOOK UP A PAPER AND IN A LOUD MO 
NOTONOUS VOICE BEGAN TO READ OUT THE DISPOSITIONS FOR THE 
IMPENDING BATTLE UNDER A HEADING WHICH HE ALSO READ OUT
DISPOSITIONS FOR AN ATTACK ON THE ENEMY POSITION BEHIND 
KOBELNITZ AND SOKOLNITZ NOVEMBER  
THE DISPOSITIONS WERE VERY COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT 
THEY BEGAN AS FOLLOWS
AS THE ENEMYS LEFT WING RESTS ON WOODED HILLS AND HIS 
RIGHT EXTENDS ALONG KOBELNITZ AND SOKOLNITZ BEHIND THE 
PONDS THAT ARE THERE WHILE WE ON THE OTHER HAND WITH OUR 
LEFT WING BY FAR OUTFLANK HIS RIGHT IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO ATTACK 
THE ENEMYS LATTER WING ESPECIALLY IF WE OCCUPY THE VILLAGES 
OF SOKOLNITZ AND KOBELNITZ WHEREBY WE CAN BOTH FALL ON HIS 
FLANK AND PURSUE HIM OVER THE PLAIN BETWEEN SCHLAPPANITZ 
AND THE THUERASSA FOREST AVOIDING THE DEFILES OF SCHLAPPAN 
ITZ AND BELLOWITZ WHICH COVER THE ENEMYS FRONT FOR THIS 
OBJECT IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE FIRST COLUMN MARCHES THE 
SECOND COLUMN MARCHES THE THIRD COLUMN MARCHES AND 
SO ON READ WEYROTHER
THE GENERALS SEEMED TO LISTEN RELUCTANTLY TO THE DIFFI 
CULT DISPOSITIONS THE TALL FAIRHAIRED GENERAL BUXHOWDEN 
STOOD LEANING HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL HIS EYES FIXED ON A 
BURNING CANDLE AND SEEMED NOT TO LISTEN OR EVEN TO WISH WAR AND PEACE TO BE THOUGHT TO LISTEN EXACTLY OPPOSITE WEYROTHER WITH

KNEES AND HIS SHOULDERS RAISED HE REMAINED STUBBORNLY 
SILENT GAZING AT WEYROTHERS FACE AND ONLY TURNED AWAY HIS 
EYES WHEN THE AUSTRIAN CHIEF OF STAFF FINISHED READING THEN 
MILORADOVICH LOOKED ROUND SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE OTHER GENER 
ALS BUT ONE COULD NOT TELL FROM THAT SIGNIFICANT LOOK WHETHER 
HE AGREED OR DISAGREED AND WAS SATISFIED OR NOT WITH THE AR 
RANGEMENTS NEXT TO WEYROTHER SAT COUNT LANGERON WHO 
WITH A SUBTLE SMILE THAT NEVER LEFT HIS TYPICALLY SOUTHERN 
FRENCH FACE DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THE READING GAZED AT 
HIS DELICATE FINGERS WHICH RAPIDLY TWIRLED BY ITS CORNERS A 
GOLD SNUFFBOX ON WHICH WAS A PORTRAIT IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE

SNUFFBOX RAISED HIS HEAD AND WITH INIMICAL POLITENESS LURK

TINUING TO READ FROWNED ANGRILY AND JERKED HIS ELBOWS AS IF 
TO SAY YOU CAN TELL ME YOUR VIEWS LATER BUT NOW BE SO GOOD 
AS TO LOOK AT THE MAP AND LISTEN LANGERON LIFTED HIS EYES 
WITH AN EXPRESSION OF PERPLEXITY TURNED ROUND TO MILORA 
DOVICH AS IF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION BUT MEETING THE LATTERS 
IMPRESSIVE BUT MEANINGLESS GAZE DROOPED HIS EYES SADLY AND 
AGAIN TOOK TO TWIRLING HIS SNUFFBOX
A GEOGRAPHY LESSON HE MUTTERED AS IF TO HIMSELF BUT 
LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD
PRZEBYSZEWSKI WITH RESPECTFUL BUT DIGNIFIED POLITENESS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHELD HIS HAND TO HIS EAR TOWARD WEYROTHER WITH THE AIR OF 
A MAN ABSORBED IN ATTENTION DOHKTUROV A LITTLE MAN SAT 
OPPOSITE WEYROTHER WITH AN ASSIDUOUS AND MODEST MIEN 
AND STOOPING OVER THE OUTSPREAD MAP CONSCIENTIOUSLY STUD 
IED THE DISPOSITIONS AND THE UNFAMILIAR LOCALITY HE ASKED 
WEYROTHER SEVERAL TIMES TO REPEAT WORDS HE HAD NOT CLEARLY 
HEARD AND THE DIFFICULT NAMES OF VILLAGES WEYROTHER COM 
PLIED AND DOHKTUROV NOTED THEM DOWN
WHEN THE READING WHICH LASTED MORE THAN AN HOUR WAS 
OVER LANGERON AGAIN BROUGHT HIS SNUFFBOX TO REST AND WITH 
OUT LOOKING AT WEYROTHER OR AT ANYONE IN PARTICULAR BEGAN 
TO SAY HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO CARRY OUT SUCH A PLAN IN WHICH 
THE ENEMYS POSITION WAS ASSUMED TO BE KNOWN WHEREAS 
IT WAS PERHAPS NOT KNOWN SINCE THE ENEMY WAS IN MOVE 
MENT LANGERONS OBJECTIONS WERE VALID BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS 
THAT THEIR CHIEF AIM WAS TO SHOW GENERAL WEYROTHERWHO 
HAD READ HIS DISPOSITIONS WITH AS MUCH SELFCONFIDENCE AS 
IF HE WERE ADDRESSING SCHOOL CHILDRENTHAT HE HAD TO DO NOT 
WITH FOOLS BUT WITH MEN WHO COULD TEACH HIM SOMETHING IN 
MILITARY MATTERS
WHEN THE MONOTONOUS SOUND OF WEYROTHERS VOICE 
CEASED KUTUZOV OPENED HIS EYE AS A MILLER WAKES UP WHEN 
THE SOPORIFIC DRONE OF THE MILL WHEEL IS INTERRUPTED HE LIS 
TENED TO WHAT LANGERON SAID AS IF REMARKING SO YOU ARE 
STILL AT THAT SILLY BUSINESS QUICKLY CLOSED HIS EYE AGAIN AND 
LET HIS HEAD SINK STILL LOWER
LANGERON TRYING AS VIRULENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO STING WEY 
ROTHERS VANITY AS AUTHOR OF THE MILITARY PLAN ARGUED THAT 
BONAPARTE MIGHT EASILY ATTACK INSTEAD OF BEING ATTACKED WAR AND PEACE AND SO RENDER THE WHOLE OF THIS PLAN PERFECTLY WORTHLESS 
WEYROTHER MET ALL OBJECTIONS WITH A FIRM AND CONTEMPTUOUS 
SMILE EVIDENTLY PREPARED BEFOREHAND TO MEET ALL OBJECTIONS 
BE THEY WHAT THEY MIGHT
IF HE COULD ATTACK US HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO TODAY SAID 
HE
SO YOU THINK HE IS POWERLESS SAID LANGERON
HE HAS FORTY THOUSAND MEN AT MOST REPLIED WEYROTHER 
WITH THE SMILE OF A DOCTOR TO WHOM AN OLD WIFE WISHES TO EX 
PLAIN THE TREATMENT OF A CASE
IN THAT CASE HE IS INVITING HIS DOOM BY AWAITING OUR AT 
TACK SAID LANGERON WITH A SUBTLY IRONICAL SMILE AGAIN 
GLANCING ROUND FOR SUPPORT TO MILORADOVICH WHO WAS NEAR 
HIM
BUT MILORADOVICH WAS AT THAT MOMENT EVIDENTLY THINKING 
OF ANYTHING RATHER THAN OF WHAT THE GENERALS WERE DISPUTING 
ABOUT
MA FOI SAID HE TOMORROW WE SHALL SEE ALL THAT ON THE 
BATTLEFIELD
WEYROTHER AGAIN GAVE THAT SMILE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY 
THAT TO HIM IT WAS STRANGE AND RIDICULOUS TO MEET OBJECTIONS 
FROM RUSSIAN GENERALS AND TO HAVE TO PROVE TO THEM WHAT 
HE HAD NOT MERELY CONVINCED HIMSELF OF BUT HAD ALSO CON 
VINCED THE SOVEREIGN EMPERORS OF
THE ENEMY HAS QUENCHED HIS FIRES AND A CONTINUAL NOISE 
IS HEARD FROM HIS CAMP SAID HE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EI 
THER HE IS RETREATING WHICH IS THE ONLY THING WE NEED FEAR 
OR HE IS CHANGING HIS POSITION HE SMILED IRONICALLY BUT 
EVEN IF HE ALSO TOOK UP A POSITION IN THE THUERASSA HE MERE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMLY SAVES US A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND ALL OUR ARRANGEMENTS 
TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL REMAIN THE SAME
HOW IS THAT BEGAN PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD FOR LONG 
BEEN WAITING AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS HIS DOUBTS
KUTUZOV HERE WOKE UP COUGHED HEAVILY AND LOOKED 
ROUND AT THE GENERALS
GENTLEMEN THE DISPOSITIONS FOR TOMORROWOR RATHER FOR 
TODAY FOR IT IS PAST MIDNIGHTCANNOT NOW BE ALTERED SAID HE 
YOU HAVE HEARD THEM AND WE SHALL ALL DO OUR DUTY BUT BE 
FORE A BATTLE THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT HE PAUSED 
THAN TO HAVE A GOOD SLEEP
HE MOVED AS IF TO RISE THE GENERALS BOWED AND RETIRED IT 
WAS PAST MIDNIGHT PRINCE ANDREW WENT OUT
THE COUNCIL OF WAR AT WHICH PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOT 
BEEN ABLE TO EXPRESS HIS OPINION AS HE HAD HOPED TO LEFT ON 
HIM A VAGUE AND UNEASY IMPRESSION WHETHER DOLGORUKOV 
AND WEYROTHER OR KUTUZOV LANGERON AND THE OTHERS WHO 
DID NOT APPROVE OF THE PLAN OF ATTACK WERE RIGHTHE DID NOT 
KNOW BUT WAS IT REALLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR KUTUZOV TO STATE HIS 
VIEWS PLAINLY TO THE EMPEROR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ON ACCOUNT 
OF COURT AND PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
LIVES AND MY LIFE MY LIFE HE THOUGHT MUST BE RISKED
YES IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT I SHALL BE KILLED TOMORROW HE 
THOUGHT AND SUDDENLY AT THIS THOUGHT OF DEATH A WHOLE 
SERIES OF MOST DISTANT MOST INTIMATE MEMORIES ROSE IN HIS 
IMAGINATION HE REMEMBERED HIS LAST PARTING FROM HIS FA 
THER AND HIS WIFE HE REMEMBERED THE DAYS WHEN HE FIRST

PRINCE BAGRATION AND PRINCE DOLGORUKOV WITH THEIR ADJU WAR AND PEACE TANTS HAD COME TO WITNESS THE CURIOUS PHENOMENON OF THE 
LIGHTS AND SHOUTS IN THE ENEMYS CAMP ROSTOV RODE UP TO 
BAGRATION REPORTED TO HIM AND THEN JOINED THE ADJUTANTS 
LISTENING TO WHAT THE GENERALS WERE SAYING
BELIEVE ME SAID PRINCE DOLGORUKOV ADDRESSING BAGRA 
TION IT IS NOTHING BUT A TRICK HE HAS RETREATED AND ORDERED 
THE REARGUARD TO KINDLE FIRES AND MAKE A NOISE TO DECEIVE

ROSTOV SPURRED HIS HORSE CALLED TO SERGEANT FEDCHENKO 
AND TWO OTHER HUSSARS TOLD THEM TO FOLLOW HIM AND TROTTED 
DOWNHILL IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE SHOUTING CAME 
HE FELT BOTH FRIGHTENED AND PLEASED TO BE RIDING ALONE WITH 
THREE HUSSARS INTO THAT MYSTERIOUS AND DANGEROUS MISTY DIS 
TANCE WHERE NO ONE HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM BAGRATION CALLED 
TO HIM FROM THE HILL NOT TO GO BEYOND THE STREAM BUT ROSTOV 
PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM AND DID NOT STOP BUT RODE ON AND 
ON CONTINUALLY MISTAKING BUSHES FOR TREES AND GULLIES FOR 
MEN AND CONTINUALLY DISCOVERING HIS MISTAKES HAVING DE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMSCENDED THE HILL AT A TROT HE NO LONGER SAW EITHER OUR OWN OR 
THE ENEMYS FIRES BUT HEARD THE SHOUTING OF THE FRENCH MORE 
LOUDLY AND DISTINCTLY IN THE VALLEY HE SAW BEFORE HIM SOME 
THING LIKE A RIVER BUT WHEN HE REACHED IT HE FOUND IT WAS A 
ROAD HAVING COME OUT ONTO THE ROAD HE REINED IN HIS HORSE 
HESITATING WHETHER TO RIDE ALONG IT OR CROSS IT AND RIDE OVER 
THE BLACK FIELD UP THE HILLSIDE TO KEEP TO THE ROAD WHICH 
GLEAMED WHITE IN THE MIST WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER BECAUSE IT 
WOULD BE EASIER TO SEE PEOPLE COMING ALONG IT FOLLOW ME 
SAID HE CROSSED THE ROAD AND BEGAN RIDING UP THE HILL AT A 
GALLOP TOWARD THE POINT WHERE THE FRENCH PICKETS HAD BEEN 
STANDING THAT EVENING
YOUR HONOR THERE HE IS CRIED ONE OF THE HUSSARS BEHIND 
HIM AND BEFORE ROSTOV HAD TIME TO MAKE OUT WHAT THE 
BLACK THING WAS THAT HAD SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE FOG THERE 
WAS A FLASH FOLLOWED BY A REPORT AND A BULLET WHIZZING HIGH 
UP IN THE MIST WITH A PLAINTIVE SOUND PASSED OUT OF HEARING 
ANOTHER MUSKET MISSED FIRE BUT FLASHED IN THE PAN ROSTOV 
TURNED HIS HORSE AND GALLOPED BACK FOUR MORE REPORTS FOL 
LOWED AT INTERVALS AND THE BULLETS PASSED SOMEWHERE IN THE 
FOG SINGING IN DIFFERENT TONES ROSTOV REINED IN HIS HORSE 
WHOSE SPIRITS HAD RISEN LIKE HIS OWN AT THE FIRING AND WENT 
BACK AT A FOOTPACE WELL SOME MORE SOME MORE A MERRY 
VOICE WAS SAYING IN HIS SOUL BUT NO MORE SHOTS CAME
ONLY WHEN APPROACHING BAGRATION DID ROSTOV LET HIS 
HORSE GALLOP AGAIN AND WITH HIS HAND AT THE SALUTE RODE UP 
TO THE GENERAL
DOLGORUKOV WAS STILL INSISTING THAT THE FRENCH HAD RE 
TREATED AND HAD ONLY LIT FIRES TO DECEIVE USWAR AND PEACE WHAT DOES THAT PROVE HE WAS SAYING AS ROSTOV RODE UP

THANK GOD
THE FIRES AND SHOUTING IN THE ENEMYS ARMY WERE OCCA 
SIONED BY THE FACT THAT WHILE NAPOLEONS PROCLAMATION WAS 
BEING READ TO THE TROOPS THE EMPEROR HIMSELF RODE ROUND  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHIS BIVOUACS THE SOLDIERS ON SEEING HIM LIT WISPS OF STRAW 
AND RAN AFTER HIM SHOUTING VIVE LEMPEREUR NAPOLEONS 
PROCLAMATION WAS AS FOLLOWS
SOLDIERS THE RUSSIAN ARMY IS ADVANCING AGAINST YOU TO 
AVENGE THE AUSTRIAN ARMY OF ULM THEY ARE THE SAME BATTAL 
IONS YOU BROKE AT HOLLABRUNN AND HAVE PURSUED EVER SINCE 
TO THIS PLACE THE POSITION WE OCCUPY IS A STRONG ONE AND 
WHILE THEY ARE MARCHING TO GO ROUND ME ON THE RIGHT THEY 
WILL EXPOSE A FLANK TO ME SOLDIERS I WILL MYSELF DIRECT YOUR 
BATTALIONS I WILL KEEP OUT OF FIRE IF YOU WITH YOUR HABITUAL 
VALOR CARRY DISORDER AND CONFUSION INTO THE ENEMYS RANKS 
BUT SHOULD VICTORY BE IN DOUBT EVEN FOR A MOMENT YOU WILL 
SEE YOUR EMPEROR EXPOSING HIMSELF TO THE FIRST BLOWS OF THE 
ENEMY FOR THERE MUST BE NO DOUBT OF VICTORY ESPECIALLY ON 
THIS DAY WHEN WHAT IS AT STAKE IS THE HONOR OF THE FRENCH IN 
FANTRY SO NECESSARY TO THE HONOR OF OUR NATION
DO NOT BREAK YOUR RANKS ON THE PLEA OF REMOVING THE 
WOUNDED LET EVERY MAN BE FULLY IMBUED WITH THE THOUGHT 
THAT WE MUST DEFEAT THESE HIRELINGS OF ENGLAND INSPIRED BY 
SUCH HATRED OF OUR NATION THIS VICTORY WILL CONCLUDE OUR 
CAMPAIGN AND WE CAN RETURN TO WINTER QUARTERS WHERE FRESH 
FRENCH TROOPS WHO ARE BEING RAISED IN FRANCE WILL JOIN US 
AND THE PEACE I SHALL CONCLUDE WILL BE WORTHY OF MY PEOPLE 
OF YOU AND OF MYSELF
NAPOLEONWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER XIV
AT FIVE IN THE MORNING IT WAS STILL QUITE DARK THE TROOPS 
OF THE CENTER THE RESERVES AND BAGRATIONS RIGHT FLANK HAD 
NOT YET MOVED BUT ON THE LEFT FLANK THE COLUMNS OF INFANTRY 
CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY WHICH WERE TO BE THE FIRST TO DESCEND 
THE HEIGHTS TO ATTACK THE FRENCH RIGHT FLANK AND DRIVE IT 
INTO THE BOHEMIAN MOUNTAINS ACCORDING TO PLAN WERE AL 
READY UP AND ASTIR THE SMOKE OF THE CAMPFIRES INTO WHICH 
THEY WERE THROWING EVERYTHING SUPERFLUOUS MADE THE EYES 
SMART IT WAS COLD AND DARK THE OFFICERS WERE HURRIEDLY 
DRINKING TEA AND BREAKFASTING THE SOLDIERS MUNCHING BIS 
CUIT AND BEATING A TATTOO WITH THEIR FEET TO WARM THEMSELVES 
GATHERING ROUND THE FIRES THROWING INTO THE FLAMES THE RE 
MAINS OF SHEDS CHAIRS TABLES WHEELS TUBS AND EVERYTHING 
THAT THEY DID NOT WANT OR COULD NOT CARRY AWAY WITH THEM 
AUSTRIAN COLUMN GUIDES WERE MOVING IN AND OUT AMONG 
THE RUSSIAN TROOPS AND SERVED AS HERALDS OF THE ADVANCE 
AS SOON AS AN AUSTRIAN OFFICER SHOWED HIMSELF NEAR A COM 
MANDING OFFICERS QUARTERS THE REGIMENT BEGAN TO MOVE 
THE SOLDIERS RAN FROM THE FIRES THRUST THEIR PIPES INTO THEIR 
BOOTS THEIR BAGS INTO THE CARTS GOT THEIR MUSKETS READY AND 
FORMED RANK THE OFFICERS BUTTONED UP THEIR COATS BUCKLED 
ON THEIR SWORDS AND POUCHES AND MOVED ALONG THE RANKS 
SHOUTING THE TRAIN DRIVERS AND ORDERLIES HARNESSED AND 
PACKED THE WAGONS AND TIED ON THE LOADS THE ADJUTANTS AND  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMBATTALION AND REGIMENTAL COMMANDERS MOUNTED CROSSED 
THEMSELVES GAVE FINAL INSTRUCTIONS ORDERS AND COMMIS 
SIONS TO THE BAGGAGE MEN WHO REMAINED BEHIND AND THE 
MONOTONOUS TRAMP OF THOUSANDS OF FEET RESOUNDED THE COL 
UMN MOVED FORWARD WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE AND UNABLE 
FROM THE MASSES AROUND THEM THE SMOKE AND THE INCREAS 
ING FOG TO SEE EITHER THE PLACE THEY WERE LEAVING OR THAT TO 
WHICH THEY WERE GOING
A SOLDIER ON THE MARCH IS HEMMED IN AND BORNE ALONG BY 
HIS REGIMENT AS MUCH AS A SAILOR IS BY HIS SHIP HOWEVER FAR 
HE HAS WALKED WHATEVER STRANGE UNKNOWN AND DANGEROUS 
PLACES HE REACHES JUST AS A SAILOR IS ALWAYS SURROUNDED BY 
THE SAME DECKS MASTS AND RIGGING OF HIS SHIP SO THE SOLDIER 
ALWAYS HAS AROUND HIM THE SAME COMRADES THE SAME RANKS 
THE SAME SERGEANT MAJOR IVAN MITRICH THE SAME COMPANY 
DOG JACK AND THE SAME COMMANDERS THE SAILOR RARELY CARES 
TO KNOW THE LATITUDE IN WHICH HIS SHIP IS SAILING BUT ON THE 
DAY OF BATTLEHEAVEN KNOWS HOW AND WHENCEA STERN NOTE OF 
WHICH ALL ARE CONSCIOUS SOUNDS IN THE MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF 
AN ARMY ANNOUNCING THE APPROACH OF SOMETHING DECISIVE 
AND SOLEMN AND AWAKENING IN THE MEN AN UNUSUAL CURI 
OSITY ON THE DAY OF BATTLE THE SOLDIERS EXCITEDLY TRY TO GET 
BEYOND THE INTERESTS OF THEIR REGIMENT THEY LISTEN INTENT 
LY LOOK ABOUT AND EAGERLY ASK CONCERNING WHAT IS GOING ON 
AROUND THEM
THE FOG HAD GROWN SO DENSE THAT THOUGH IT WAS GROWING 
LIGHT THEY COULD NOT SEE TEN PACES AHEAD BUSHES LOOKED LIKE 
GIGANTIC TREES AND LEVEL GROUND LIKE CLIFFS AND SLOPES ANY 
WHERE ON ANY SIDE ONE MIGHT ENCOUNTER AN ENEMY INVISIBLE WAR AND PEACE TEN PACES OFF BUT THE COLUMNS ADVANCED FOR A LONG TIME 
ALWAYS IN THE SAME FOG DESCENDING AND ASCENDING HILLS 
AVOIDING GARDENS AND ENCLOSURES GOING OVER NEW AND UN 
KNOWN GROUND AND NOWHERE ENCOUNTERING THE ENEMY ON 
THE CONTRARY THE SOLDIERS BECAME AWARE THAT IN FRONT BE 
HIND AND ON ALL SIDES OTHER RUSSIAN COLUMNS WERE MOVING 
IN THE SAME DIRECTION EVERY SOLDIER FELT GLAD TO KNOW THAT TO 
THE UNKNOWN PLACE WHERE HE WAS GOING MANY MORE OF OUR 
MEN WERE GOING TOO
THERE NOW THE KURSKIES HAVE ALSO GONE PAST WAS BEING 
SAID IN THE RANKS
ITS WONDERFUL WHAT A LOT OF OUR TROOPS HAVE GATHERED 
LADS LAST NIGHT I LOOKED AT THE CAMPFIRES AND THERE WAS NO 
END OF THEM A REGULAR MOSCOW
THOUGH NONE OF THE COLUMN COMMANDERS RODE UP TO THE 
RANKS OR TALKED TO THE MEN THE COMMANDERS AS WE SAW AT 
THE COUNCIL OF WAR WERE OUT OF HUMOR AND DISSATISFIED WITH 
THE AFFAIR AND SO DID NOT EXERT THEMSELVES TO CHEER THE MEN 
BUT MERELY CARRIED OUT THE ORDERS YET THE TROOPS MARCHED 
GAILY AS THEY ALWAYS DO WHEN GOING INTO ACTION ESPECIALLY 
TO AN ATTACK BUT WHEN THEY HAD MARCHED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR 
IN THE DENSE FOG THE GREATER PART OF THE MEN HAD TO HALT AND 
AN UNPLEASANT CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME DISLOCATION AND BLUN 
DER SPREAD THROUGH THE RANKS HOW SUCH A CONSCIOUSNESS IS 
COMMUNICATED IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFINE BUT IT CERTAINLY IS 
COMMUNICATED VERY SURELY AND FLOWS RAPIDLY IMPERCEPTIBLY 
AND IRREPRESSIBLY AS WATER DOES IN A CREEK HAD THE RUSSIAN 
ARMY BEEN ALONE WITHOUT ANY ALLIES IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE 
BEEN A LONG TIME BEFORE THIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISMANAGE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMMENT BECAME A GENERAL CONVICTION BUT AS IT WAS THE DISORDER 
WAS READILY AND NATURALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE STUPID GERMANS 
AND EVERYONE WAS CONVINCED THAT A DANGEROUS MUDDLE HAD 
BEEN OCCASIONED BY THE SAUSAGE EATERS
WHY HAVE WE STOPPED IS THE WAY BLOCKED OR HAVE WE 
ALREADY COME UP AGAINST THE FRENCH
NO ONE CANT HEAR THEM THEYD BE FIRING IF WE HAD
THEY WERE IN A HURRY ENOUGH TO START US AND NOW HERE 
WE STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD WITHOUT RHYME OR REASON 
ITS ALL THOSE DAMNED GERMANS MUDDLING WHAT STUPID 
DEVILS
YES ID SEND THEM ON IN FRONT BUT NO FEAR THEYRE CROWD 
ING UP BEHIND AND NOW HERE WE STAND HUNGRY
I SAY SHALL WE SOON BE CLEAR THEY SAY THE CAVALRY ARE 
BLOCKING THE WAY SAID AN OFFICER
AH THOSE DAMNED GERMANS THEY DONT KNOW THEIR OWN 
COUNTRY SAID ANOTHER
WHAT DIVISION ARE YOU SHOUTED AN ADJUTANT RIDING UP
THE EIGHTEENTH
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE ON LONG 
AGO NOW YOU WONT GET THERE TILL EVENING
WHAT STUPID ORDERS THEY DONT THEMSELVES KNOW WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING SAID THE OFFICER AND RODE OFF
THEN A GENERAL RODE PAST SHOUTING SOMETHING ANGRILY NOT 
IN RUSSIAN
TAFALAFA BUT WHAT HES JABBERING NO ONE CAN MAKE OUT 
SAID A SOLDIER MIMICKING THE GENERAL WHO HAD RIDDEN AWAY 
ID SHOOT THEM THE SCOUNDRELS
WE WERE ORDERED TO BE AT THE PLACE BEFORE NINE BUT WE WAR AND PEACE HAVENT GOT HALFWAY FINE ORDERS WAS BEING REPEATED ON DIF 
FERENT SIDES
AND THE FEELING OF ENERGY WITH WHICH THE TROOPS HAD 
STARTED BEGAN TO TURN INTO VEXATION AND ANGER AT THE STUPID 
ARRANGEMENTS AND AT THE GERMANS
THE CAUSE OF THE CONFUSION WAS THAT WHILE THE AUSTRIAN 
CAVALRY WAS MOVING TOWARD OUR LEFT FLANK THE HIGHER COM 
MAND FOUND THAT OUR CENTER WAS TOO FAR SEPARATED FROM OUR 
RIGHT FLANK AND THE CAVALRY WERE ALL ORDERED TO TURN BACK TO 
THE RIGHT SEVERAL THOUSAND CAVALRY CROSSED IN FRONT OF THE 
INFANTRY WHO HAD TO WAIT
AT THE FRONT AN ALTERCATION OCCURRED BETWEEN AN AUSTRIAN 
GUIDE AND A RUSSIAN GENERAL THE GENERAL SHOUTED A DEMAND 
THAT THE CAVALRY SHOULD BE HALTED THE AUSTRIAN ARGUED THAT 
NOT HE BUT THE HIGHER COMMAND WAS TO BLAME THE TROOPS 
MEANWHILE STOOD GROWING LISTLESS AND DISPIRITED AFTER AN

NOT EXPECTING TO COME ON THE ENEMY DOWN BY THE

ENCOURAGING WORD FROM THEIR COMMANDERS AND WITH A CON 
SCIOUSNESS OF BEING TOO LATE SPREADING THROUGH THE RANKS 
AND ABOVE ALL BEING UNABLE TO SEE ANYTHING IN FRONT OR 
AROUND THEM IN THE THICK FOG THE RUSSIANS EXCHANGED SHOTS 
WITH THE ENEMY LAZILY AND ADVANCED AND AGAIN HALTED RE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCEIVING NO TIMELY ORDERS FROM THE OFFICERS OR ADJUTANTS WHO

ON ONE SPOT HIS PREDICTIONS WERE BEING JUSTIFIED PART OF THE 
RUSSIAN FORCE HAD ALREADY DESCENDED INTO THE VALLEY TOWARD 
THE PONDS AND LAKES AND PART WERE LEAVING THESE PRATZEN 
HEIGHTS WHICH HE INTENDED TO ATTACK AND REGARDED AS THE 
KEY TO THE POSITION HE SAW OVER THE MIST THAT IN A HOLLOW 
BETWEEN TWO HILLS NEAR THE VILLAGE OF PRATZEN THE RUSSIAN 
COLUMNS THEIR BAYONETS GLITTERING WERE MOVING CONTINU 
OUSLY IN ONE DIRECTION TOWARD THE VALLEY AND DISAPPEARING 
ONE AFTER ANOTHER INTO THE MIST FROM INFORMATION HE HAD 
RECEIVED THE EVENING BEFORE FROM THE SOUND OF WHEELS AND 
FOOTSTEPS HEARD BY THE OUTPOSTS DURING THE NIGHT BY THE DIS 
ORDERLY MOVEMENT OF THE RUSSIAN COLUMNS AND FROM ALL 
INDICATIONS HE SAW CLEARLY THAT THE ALLIES BELIEVED HIM TO 
BE FAR AWAY IN FRONT OF THEM AND THAT THE COLUMNS MOV 
ING NEAR PRATZEN CONSTITUTED THE CENTER OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY 
AND THAT THAT CENTER WAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY WEAKENED TO BE 
SUCCESSFULLY ATTACKED BUT STILL HE DID NOT BEGIN THE ENGAGE

TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY FOR HIMTHE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS 
CORONATION BEFORE DAWN HE HAD SLEPT FOR A FEW HOURS AND 
REFRESHED VIGOROUS AND IN GOOD SPIRITS HE MOUNTED HIS 
HORSE AND RODE OUT INTO THE FIELD IN THAT HAPPY MOOD IN 
WHICH EVERYTHING SEEMS POSSIBLE AND EVERYTHING SUCCEEDS 
HE SAT MOTIONLESS LOOKING AT THE HEIGHTS VISIBLE ABOVE THE

THEY COULD BE KNOWN TO ANYONE IN OUR ARMY HIS OWN STRA 
TEGIC PLAN WHICH OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT NOW BE CARRIED OUT 
WAS FORGOTTEN NOW ENTERING INTO WEYROTHERS PLAN PRINCE 
ANDREW CONSIDERED POSSIBLE CONTINGENCIES AND FORMED NEW 
PROJECTS SUCH AS MIGHT CALL FOR HIS RAPIDITY OF PERCEPTION AND 
DECISION
TO THE LEFT DOWN BELOW IN THE MIST THE MUSKETRY FIRE OF 
UNSEEN FORCES COULD BE HEARD IT WAS THERE PRINCE ANDREW 
THOUGHT THE FIGHT WOULD CONCENTRATE THERE WE SHALL EN  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES AND THERE THOUGHT HE I SHALL BE SENT 
WITH A BRIGADE OR DIVISION AND THERE STANDARD IN HAND I 
SHALL GO FORWARD AND BREAK WHATEVER IS IN FRONT OF ME
HE COULD NOT LOOK CALMLY AT THE STANDARDS OF THE PASSING 
BATTALIONS SEEING THEM HE KEPT THINKING THAT MAY BE THE 
VERY STANDARD WITH WHICH I SHALL LEAD THE ARMY
IN THE MORNING ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THE NIGHT MIST ON THE 
HEIGHTS WAS A HOAR FROST NOW TURNING TO DEW BUT IN THE VAL 
LEYS IT STILL LAY LIKE A MILKWHITE SEA NOTHING WAS VISIBLE IN 
THE VALLEY TO THE LEFT INTO WHICH OUR TROOPS HAD DESCEND 
ED AND FROM WHENCE CAME THE SOUNDS OF FIRING ABOVE THE 
HEIGHTS WAS THE DARK CLEAR SKY AND TO THE RIGHT THE VAST ORB 
OF THE SUN IN FRONT FAR OFF ON THE FARTHER SHORE OF THAT SEA OF 
MIST SOME WOODED HILLS WERE DISCERNIBLE AND IT WAS THERE 
THE ENEMY PROBABLY WAS FOR SOMETHING COULD BE DESCRIED 
ON THE RIGHT THE GUARDS WERE ENTERING THE MISTY REGION 
WITH A SOUND OF HOOFS AND WHEELS AND NOW AND THEN A GLEAM 
OF BAYONETS TO THE LEFT BEYOND THE VILLAGE SIMILAR MASSES 
OF CAVALRY CAME UP AND DISAPPEARED IN THE SEA OF MIST IN 
FRONT AND BEHIND MOVED INFANTRY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
WAS STANDING AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE LETTING THE TROOPS PASS 
BY HIM THAT MORNING KUTUZOV SEEMED WORN AND IRRITABLE 
THE INFANTRY PASSING BEFORE HIM CAME TO A HALT WITHOUT ANY 
COMMAND BEING GIVEN APPARENTLY OBSTRUCTED BY SOMETHING 
IN FRONT
DO ORDER THEM TO FORM INTO BATTALION COLUMNS AND GO 
ROUND THE VILLAGE HE SAID ANGRILY TO A GENERAL WHO HAD RID 
DEN UP DONT YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR EXCELLENCY MY DEAR 
SIR THAT YOU MUST NOT DEFILE THROUGH NARROW VILLAGE STREETS WAR AND PEACE WHEN WE ARE MARCHING AGAINST THE ENEMY
I INTENDED TO REFORM THEM BEYOND THE VILLAGE YOUR EX 
CELLENCY ANSWERED THE GENERAL
KUTUZOV LAUGHED BITTERLY
YOULL MAKE A FINE THING OF IT DEPLOYING IN SIGHT OF THE 
ENEMY VERY FINE
THE ENEMY IS STILL FAR AWAY YOUR EXCELLENCY ACCORDING 
TO THE DISPOSITIONS
THE DISPOSITIONS EXCLAIMED KUTUZOV BITTERLY WHO TOLD 
YOU THAT KINDLY DO AS YOU ARE ORDERED
YES SIR
MY DEAR FELLOW NESVITSKI WHISPERED TO PRINCE ANDREW 
THE OLD MAN IS AS SURLY AS A DOG
AN AUSTRIAN OFFICER IN A WHITE UNIFORM WITH GREEN PLUMES 
IN HIS HAT GALLOPED UP TO KUTUZOV AND ASKED IN THE EMPER 
ORS NAME HAD THE FOURTH COLUMN ADVANCED INTO ACTION
KUTUZOV TURNED ROUND WITHOUT ANSWERING AND HIS EYE 
HAPPENED TO FALL UPON PRINCE ANDREW WHO WAS BESIDE HIM 
SEEING HIM KUTUZOVS MALEVOLENT AND CAUSTIC EXPRESSION 
SOFTENED AS IF ADMITTING THAT WHAT WAS BEING DONE WAS NOT 
HIS ADJUTANTS FAULT AND STILL NOT ANSWERING THE AUSTRIAN AD 
JUTANT HE ADDRESSED BOLKONSKI
GO MY DEAR FELLOW AND SEE WHETHER THE THIRD DIVISION 
HAS PASSED THE VILLAGE TELL IT TO STOP AND AWAIT MY ORDERS
HARDLY HAD PRINCE ANDREW STARTED THAN HE STOPPED 
HIM
AND ASK WHETHER SHARPSHOOTERS HAVE BEEN POSTED HE 
ADDED WHAT ARE THEY DOING WHAT ARE THEY DOING HE 
MURMURED TO HIMSELF STILL NOT REPLYING TO THE AUSTRIAN FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMPRINCE ANDREW GALLOPED OFF TO EXECUTE THE ORDER
OVERTAKING THE BATTALIONS THAT CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HE 
STOPPED THE THIRD DIVISION AND CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT THERE 
REALLY WERE NO SHARPSHOOTERS IN FRONT OF OUR COLUMNS THE 
COLONEL AT THE HEAD OF THE REGIMENT WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT 
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEFS ORDER TO THROW OUT SKIRMISHERS 
HE HAD FELT PERFECTLY SURE THAT THERE WERE OTHER TROOPS IN 
FRONT OF HIM AND THAT THE ENEMY MUST BE AT LEAST SIX MILES 
AWAY THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING TO BE SEEN IN FRONT EXCEPT A 
BARREN DESCENT HIDDEN BY DENSE MIST HAVING GIVEN ORDERS 
IN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEFS NAME TO RECTIFY THIS OMISSION 
PRINCE ANDREW GALLOPED BACK KUTUZOV STILL IN THE SAME 
PLACE HIS STOUT BODY RESTING HEAVILY IN THE SADDLE WITH THE 
LASSITUDE OF AGE SAT YAWNING WEARILY WITH CLOSED EYES THE 
TROOPS WERE NO LONGER MOVING BUT STOOD WITH THE BUTTS OF 
THEIR MUSKETS ON THE GROUND
ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT HE SAID TO PRINCE ANDREW AND TURNED 
TO A GENERAL WHO WATCH IN HAND WAS SAYING IT WAS TIME THEY 
STARTED AS ALL THE LEFTFLANK COLUMNS HAD ALREADY DESCENDED
PLENTY OF TIME YOUR EXCELLENCY MUTTERED KUTUZOV IN 
THE MIDST OF A YAWN PLENTY OF TIME HE REPEATED
JUST THEN AT A DISTANCE BEHIND KUTUZOV WAS HEARD THE 
SOUND OF REGIMENTS SALUTING AND THIS SOUND RAPIDLY CAME 
NEARER ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENDED LINE OF THE ADVANCING RUS 
SIAN COLUMNS EVIDENTLY THE PERSON THEY WERE GREETING WAS 
RIDING QUICKLY WHEN THE SOLDIERS OF THE REGIMENT IN FRONT 
OF WHICH KUTUZOV WAS STANDING BEGAN TO SHOUT HE RODE A 
LITTLE TO ONE SIDE AND LOOKED ROUND WITH A FROWN ALONG THE 
ROAD FROM PRATZEN GALLOPED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SQUADRON OF WAR AND PEACE HORSEMEN IN VARIOUS UNIFORMS TWO OF THEM RODE SIDE BY 
SIDE IN FRONT AT FULL GALLOP ONE IN A BLACK UNIFORM WITH 
WHITE PLUMES IN HIS HAT RODE A BOBTAILED CHESTNUT HORSE THE 
OTHER WHO WAS IN A WHITE UNIFORM RODE A BLACK ONE THESE 
WERE THE TWO EMPERORS FOLLOWED BY THEIR SUITES KUTUZOV 
AFFECTING THE MANNERS OF AN OLD SOLDIER AT THE FRONT GAVE THE 
COMMAND ATTENTION AND RODE UP TO THE EMPERORS WITH A 
SALUTE HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE AND MANNER WERE SUDDENLY 
TRANSFORMED HE PUT ON THE AIR OF A SUBORDINATE WHO OBEYS 
WITHOUT REASONING WITH AN AFFECTATION OF RESPECT WHICH 
EVIDENTLY STRUCK ALEXANDER UNPLEASANTLY HE RODE UP AND 
SALUTED
THIS UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION MERELY FLITTED OVER THE YOUNG 
AND HAPPY FACE OF THE EMPEROR LIKE A CLOUD OF HAZE ACROSS 
A CLEAR SKY AND VANISHED AFTER HIS ILLNESS HE LOOKED RATHER 
THINNER THAT DAY THAN ON THE FIELD OF OLMUTZ WHERE BOLKON 
SKI HAD SEEN HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME ABROAD BUT THERE WAS 
STILL THE SAME BEWITCHING COMBINATION OF MAJESTY AND MILD 
NESS IN HIS FINE GRAY EYES AND ON HIS DELICATE LIPS THE SAME 
CAPACITY FOR VARYING EXPRESSION AND THE SAME PREVALENT AP 
PEARANCE OF GOODHEARTED INNOCENT YOUTH
AT THE OLMUTZ REVIEW HE HAD SEEMED MORE MAJESTIC HERE 
HE SEEMED BRIGHTER AND MORE ENERGETIC HE WAS SLIGHTLY 
FLUSHED AFTER GALLOPING TWO MILES AND REINING IN HIS HORSE 
HE SIGHED RESTFULLY AND LOOKED ROUND AT THE FACES OF HIS 
SUITE YOUNG AND ANIMATED AS HIS OWN CZARTORYSKI NO

TUZOV WITH HIS SUITE DIMINISHED BY MORE THAN HALF RODE 
TOWARD A SOUND OF ARTILLERY FIRE NEAR BY HAVING FORCED HIS 
WAY OUT OF THE CROWD OF FUGITIVES PRINCE ANDREW TRYING 
TO KEEP NEAR KUTUZOV SAW ON THE SLOPE OF THE HILL AMID THE 
SMOKE A RUSSIAN BATTERY THAT WAS STILL FIRING AND FRENCH 
MEN RUNNING TOWARD IT HIGHER UP STOOD SOME RUSSIAN 
INFANTRY NEITHER MOVING FORWARD TO PROTECT THE BATTERY NOR 
BACKWARD WITH THE FLEEING CROWD A MOUNTED GENERAL SEPA

NER WITH HIS SHAKO KNOCKED AWRY PULLING ONE END OF A MOP 
WHILE A FRENCH SOLDIER TUGGED AT THE OTHER HE COULD DIS 
TINCTLY SEE THE DISTRAUGHT YET ANGRY EXPRESSION ON THE FACES

TO AVERT RESPONSIBILITY FROM HIMSELF PRINCE BAGRATION PRO 
POSED TO DOLGORUKOV TO SEND TO INQUIRE OF THE COMMANDER 
IN CHIEF BAGRATION KNEW THAT AS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE 
TWO FLANKS WAS MORE THAN SIX MILES EVEN IF THE MESSENGER 
WERE NOT KILLED WHICH HE VERY LIKELY WOULD BE AND FOUND 
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHICH WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT HE 
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK BEFORE EVENING
BAGRATION CAST HIS LARGE EXPRESSIONLESS SLEEPY EYES ROUND 
HIS SUITE AND THE BOYISH FACE ROSTOV BREATHLESS WITH EXCITE 
MENT AND HOPE WAS THE FIRST TO CATCH HIS EYE HE SENT HIM
AND IF I SHOULD MEET HIS MAJESTY BEFORE I MEET THE COM 
MANDER IN CHIEF YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID ROSTOV WITH HIS 
HAND TO HIS CAP
YOU CAN GIVE THE MESSAGE TO HIS MAJESTY SAID DOLGORU 
KOV HURRIEDLY INTERRUPTING BAGRATION
ON BEING RELIEVED FROM PICKET DUTY ROSTOV HAD MANAGED 
TO GET A FEW HOURS SLEEP BEFORE MORNING AND FELT CHEERFUL 
BOLD AND RESOLUTE WITH ELASTICITY OF MOVEMENT FAITH IN HIS 
GOOD FORTUNE AND GENERALLY IN THAT STATE OF MIND WHICH 
MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM POSSIBLE PLEASANT AND EASY
ALL HIS WISHES WERE BEING FULFILLED THAT MORNING THERE WAR AND PEACE WAS TO BE A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT IN WHICH HE WAS TAKING PART 
MORE THAN THAT HE WAS ORDERLY TO THE BRAVEST GENERAL AND 
STILL MORE HE WAS GOING WITH A MESSAGE TO KUTUZOV PERHAPS 
EVEN TO THE SOVEREIGN HIMSELF THE MORNING WAS BRIGHT HE 
HAD A GOOD HORSE UNDER HIM AND HIS HEART WAS FULL OF JOY 
AND HAPPINESS ON RECEIVING THE ORDER HE GAVE HIS HORSE THE 
REIN AND GALLOPED ALONG THE LINE AT FIRST HE RODE ALONG THE 
LINE OF BAGRATIONS TROOPS WHICH HAD NOT YET ADVANCED INTO 
ACTION BUT WERE STANDING MOTIONLESS THEN HE CAME TO THE RE 
GION OCCUPIED BY UVAROVS CAVALRY AND HERE HE NOTICED A STIR 
AND SIGNS OF PREPARATION FOR BATTLE HAVING PASSED UVAROVS 
CAVALRY HE CLEARLY HEARD THE SOUND OF CANNON AND MUSKETRY 
AHEAD OF HIM THE FIRING GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
IN THE FRESH MORNING AIR WERE NOW HEARD NOT TWO OR 
THREE MUSKET SHOTS AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS AS BEFORE FOLLOWED 
BY ONE OR TWO CANNON SHOTS BUT A ROLL OF VOLLEYS OF MUSKET 
RY FROM THE SLOPES OF THE HILL BEFORE PRATZEN INTERRUPTED BY 
SUCH FREQUENT REPORTS OF CANNON THAT SOMETIMES SEVERAL OF 
THEM WERE NOT SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER BUT MERGED INTO 
A GENERAL ROAR
HE COULD SEE PUFFS OF MUSKETRY SMOKE THAT SEEMED TO 
CHASE ONE ANOTHER DOWN THE HILLSIDES AND CLOUDS OF CANNON 
SMOKE ROLLING SPREADING AND MINGLING WITH ONE ANOTHER 
HE COULD ALSO BY THE GLEAM OF BAYONETS VISIBLE THROUGH THE 
SMOKE MAKE OUT MOVING MASSES OF INFANTRY AND NARROW 
LINES OF ARTILLERY WITH GREEN CAISSONS
ROSTOV STOPPED HIS HORSE FOR A MOMENT ON A HILLOCK TO 
SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT STRAIN HIS ATTENTION AS HE WOULD 
HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND OR MAKE OUT ANYTHING OF WHAT WAS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHAPPENING THERE IN THE SMOKE MEN OF SOME SORT WERE MOV 
ING ABOUT IN FRONT AND BEHIND MOVED LINES OF TROOPS BUT 
WHY WHITHER AND WHO THEY WERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE 
OUT THESE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS HAD NO DEPRESSING OR INTIMI 
DATING EFFECT ON HIM ON THE CONTRARY THEY STIMULATED HIS 
ENERGY AND DETERMINATION
GO ON GO ON GIVE IT THEM HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AT 
THESE SOUNDS AND AGAIN PROCEEDED TO GALLOP ALONG THE LINE 
PENETRATING FARTHER AND FARTHER INTO THE REGION WHERE THE 
ARMY WAS ALREADY IN ACTION
HOW IT WILL BE THERE I DONT KNOW BUT ALL WILL BE WELL 
THOUGHT ROSTOV
AFTER PASSING SOME AUSTRIAN TROOPS HE NOTICED THAT THE 
NEXT PART OF THE LINE THE GUARDS WAS ALREADY IN ACTION
SO MUCH THE BETTER I SHALL SEE IT CLOSE HE THOUGHT
HE WAS RIDING ALMOST ALONG THE FRONT LINE A HANDFUL OF 
MEN CAME GALLOPING TOWARD HIM THEY WERE OUR UHLANS 
WHO WITH DISORDERED RANKS WERE RETURNING FROM THE ATTACK 
ROSTOV GOT OUT OF THEIR WAY INVOLUNTARILY NOTICED THAT ONE 
OF THEM WAS BLEEDING AND GALLOPED ON
THAT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE HE THOUGHT HE HAD NOT RID 
DEN MANY HUNDRED YARDS AFTER THAT BEFORE HE SAW TO HIS LEFT 
ACROSS THE WHOLE WIDTH OF THE FIELD AN ENORMOUS MASS OF 
CAVALRY IN BRILLIANT WHITE UNIFORMS MOUNTED ON BLACK HORS 
ES TROTTING STRAIGHT TOWARD HIM AND ACROSS HIS PATH ROSTOV 
PUT HIS HORSE TO FULL GALLOP TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THESE MEN 
AND HE WOULD HAVE GOT CLEAR HAD THEY CONTINUED AT THE SAME 
SPEED BUT THEY KEPT INCREASING THEIR PACE SO THAT SOME OF 
THE HORSES WERE ALREADY GALLOPING ROSTOV HEARD THE THUD WAR AND PEACE OF THEIR HOOFS AND THE JINGLE OF THEIR WEAPONS AND SAW THEIR 
HORSES THEIR FIGURES AND EVEN THEIR FACES MORE AND MORE 
DISTINCTLY THEY WERE OUR HORSE GUARDS ADVANCING TO ATTACK 
THE FRENCH CAVALRY THAT WAS COMING TO MEET THEM
THE HORSE GUARDS WERE GALLOPING BUT STILL HOLDING IN 
THEIR HORSES ROSTOV COULD ALREADY SEE THEIR FACES AND HEARD 
THE COMMAND CHARGE SHOUTED BY AN OFFICER WHO WAS URG 
ING HIS THOROUGHBRED TO FULL SPEED ROSTOV FEARING TO BE 
CRUSHED OR SWEPT INTO THE ATTACK ON THE FRENCH GALLOPED 
ALONG THE FRONT AS HARD AS HIS HORSE COULD GO BUT STILL WAS 
NOT IN TIME TO AVOID THEM
THE LAST OF THE HORSE GUARDS A HUGE POCKMARKED FELLOW 
FROWNED ANGRILY ON SEEING ROSTOV BEFORE HIM WITH WHOM 
HE WOULD INEVITABLY COLLIDE THIS GUARDSMAN WOULD CER 
TAINLY HAVE BOWLED ROSTOV AND HIS BEDOUIN OVER ROSTOV 
FELT HIMSELF QUITE TINY AND WEAK COMPARED TO THESE GIGANTIC 
MEN AND HORSES HAD IT NOT OCCURRED TO ROSTOV TO FLOUR 
ISH HIS WHIP BEFORE THE EYES OF THE GUARDSMANS HORSE THE 
HEAVY BLACK HORSE SIXTEEN HANDS HIGH SHIED THROWING BACK 
ITS EARS BUT THE POCKMARKED GUARDSMAN DROVE HIS HUGE 
SPURS IN VIOLENTLY AND THE HORSE FLOURISHING ITS TAIL AND 
EXTENDING ITS NECK GALLOPED ON YET FASTER HARDLY HAD THE 
HORSE GUARDS PASSED ROSTOV BEFORE HE HEARD THEM SHOUT 
HURRAH AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT THEIR FOREMOST RANKS 
WERE MIXED UP WITH SOME FOREIGN CAVALRY WITH RED EPAULETS 
PROBABLY FRENCH HE COULD SEE NOTHING MORE FOR IMMEDI 
ATELY AFTERWARDS CANNON BEGAN FIRING FROM SOMEWHERE AND 
SMOKE ENVELOPED EVERYTHING
AT THAT MOMENT AS THE HORSE GUARDS HAVING PASSED  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHIM DISAPPEARED IN THE SMOKE ROSTOV HESITATED WHETHER 
TO GALLOP AFTER THEM OR TO GO WHERE HE WAS SENT THIS WAS 
THE BRILLIANT CHARGE OF THE HORSE GUARDS THAT AMAZED THE 
FRENCH THEMSELVES ROSTOV WAS HORRIFIED TO HEAR LATER THAT OF 
ALL THAT MASS OF HUGE AND HANDSOME MEN OF ALL THOSE BRIL 
LIANT RICH YOUTHS OFFICERS AND CADETS WHO HAD GALLOPED PAST 
HIM ON THEIR THOUSANDRUBLE HORSES ONLY EIGHTEEN WERE LEFT 
AFTER THE CHARGE
WHY SHOULD I ENVY THEM MY CHANCE IS NOT LOST AND 
MAYBE I SHALL SEE THE EMPEROR IMMEDIATELY  THOUGHT ROS 
TOV AND GALLOPED ON
WHEN HE CAME LEVEL WITH THE FOOT GUARDS HE NOTICED 
THAT ABOUT THEM AND AROUND THEM CANNON BALLS WERE FLYING

HOW THE GUARDS HAVING TAKEN UP THEIR POSITION AND SEEING

ROSTOV TO AVOID AGAIN GETTING IN FRONT OF THE FIRST LINE AS 
HE HAD DONE WHEN THE HORSE GUARDS CHARGED FOLLOWED THE 
LINE OF RESERVES GOING FAR ROUND THE PLACE WHERE THE HOT

HEARD MUSKET FIRE QUITE CLOSE IN FRONT OF HIM AND BEHIND  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMOUR TROOPS WHERE HE COULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED THE ENEMY 
TO BE
WHAT CAN IT BE HE THOUGHT THE ENEMY IN THE REAR OF

TLE BUT BE THAT WHAT IT MAY HE REFLECTED THERE IS NO RIDING

THE FOREBODING OF EVIL THAT HAD SUDDENLY COME OVER ROS

THE IDEA OF DEFEAT AND FLIGHT COULD NOT ENTER ROSTOVS

BELIEVE THAT FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER XVIII

EXTRAORDINARY EXPLANATION OF SO STRANGE AN EVENT IN THE 
ENGLISH CLUB WHERE ALL WHO WERE DISTINGUISHED IMPORTANT 
AND WELL INFORMED FORGATHERED WHEN THE NEWS BEGAN TO AR 
RIVE IN DECEMBER NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT THE WAR AND THE

VYAZEMSKIDID NOT SHOW THEMSELVES AT THE CLUB BUT MET IN 
PRIVATE HOUSES IN INTIMATE CIRCLES AND THE MOSCOVITES WHO 
TOOK THEIR OPINIONS FROM OTHERSILYA ROSTOV AMONG THEM 
REMAINED FOR A WHILE WITHOUT ANY DEFINITE OPINION ON THE 
SUBJECT OF THE WAR AND WITHOUT LEADERS THE MOSCOVITES FELT 
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND THAT TO DISCUSS THE BAD NEWS 
WAS DIFFICULT AND SO IT WAS BEST TO BE SILENT BUT AFTER A WHILE 
JUST AS A JURY COMES OUT OF ITS ROOM THE BIGWIGS WHO GUID 
ED THE CLUBS OPINION REAPPEARED AND EVERYBODY BEGAN 
SPEAKING CLEARLY AND DEFINITELY REASONS WERE FOUND FOR THE 
INCREDIBLE UNHEARDOF AND IMPOSSIBLE EVENT OF A RUSSIAN 
DEFEAT EVERYTHING BECAME CLEAR AND IN ALL CORNERS OF MOS

THE TREACHERY OF THE AUSTRIANS A DEFECTIVE COMMISSARIAT THE 
TREACHERY OF THE POLE PRZEBYSZEWSKI AND OF THE FRENCHMAN 
LANGERON KUTUZOVS INCAPACITY AND IT WAS WHISPERED THE

FROM AUSTERLITZ WHERE HE ALONE HAD WITHDRAWN HIS COLUMN 
UNBROKEN AND HAD ALL DAY BEATEN BACK AN ENEMY FORCE TWICE 
AS NUMEROUS AS HIS OWN WHAT ALSO CONDUCED TO BAGRATIONS 
BEING SELECTED AS MOSCOWS HERO WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD 
NO CONNECTIONS IN THE CITY AND WAS A STRANGER THERE IN HIS 
PERSON HONOR WAS SHOWN TO A SIMPLE FIGHTING RUSSIAN SOL 
DIER WITHOUT CONNECTIONS AND INTRIGUES AND TO ONE WHO WAS 
ASSOCIATED BY MEMORIES OF THE ITALIAN CAMPAIGN WITH THE 
NAME OF SUVOROV MOREOVER PAYING SUCH HONOR TO BAGRA 
TION WAS THE BEST WAY OF EXPRESSING DISAPPROVAL AND DISLIKE 
OF KUTUZOV

THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE HIS FACE WAS DEPRESSED AND GLOOMY 
HE SEEMED TO SEE AND HEAR NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON 
AROUND HIM AND TO BE ABSORBED BY SOME DEPRESSING AND UN 
SOLVED PROBLEM
THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM THAT TORMENTED HIM WAS CAUSED 
BY HINTS GIVEN BY THE PRINCESS HIS COUSIN AT MOSCOW CON 
CERNING DOLOKHOVS INTIMACY WITH HIS WIFE AND BY AN 
ANONYMOUS LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED THAT MORNING WHICH IN 
THE MEAN JOCULAR WAY COMMON TO ANONYMOUS LETTERS SAID 
THAT HE SAW BADLY THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES BUT THAT HIS WIFES 
CONNECTION WITH DOLOKHOV WAS A SECRET TO NO ONE BUT HIM 
SELF PIERRE ABSOLUTELY DISBELIEVED BOTH THE PRINCESS HINTS 
AND THE LETTER BUT HE FEARED NOW TO LOOK AT DOLOKHOV WHO 
WAS SITTING OPPOSITE HIM EVERY TIME HE CHANCED TO MEET 
DOLOKHOVS HANDSOME INSOLENT EYES PIERRE FELT SOMETHING 
TERRIBLE AND MONSTROUS RISING IN HIS SOUL AND TURNED QUICKLY 
AWAY INVOLUNTARILY RECALLING HIS WIFES PAST AND HER RELATIONS 
WITH DOLOKHOV PIERRE SAW CLEARLY THAT WHAT WAS SAID IN THE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMLETTER MIGHT BE TRUE OR MIGHT AT LEAST SEEM TO BE TRUE HAD IT 
NOT REFERRED TO HIS WIFE HE INVOLUNTARILY REMEMBERED HOW 
DOLOKHOV WHO HAD FULLY RECOVERED HIS FORMER POSITION AFTER

AVAILING HIMSELF OF HIS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH PIERRE AS A 
BOON COMPANION DOLOKHOV HAD COME STRAIGHT TO HIS HOUSE

CALLED HOW HELENE HAD SMILINGLY EXPRESSED DISAPPROVAL OF 
DOLOKHOVS LIVING AT THEIR HOUSE AND HOW CYNICALLY DOLOK 
HOV HAD PRAISED HIS WIFES BEAUTY TO HIM AND FROM THAT TIME 
TILL THEY CAME TO MOSCOW HAD NOT LEFT THEM FOR A DAY

HIM IT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY PLEASANT TO HIM TO DISHONOR 
MY NAME AND RIDICULE ME JUST BECAUSE I HAVE EXERTED MY 
SELF ON HIS BEHALF BEFRIENDED HIM AND HELPED HIM I KNOW 
AND UNDERSTAND WHAT A SPICE THAT WOULD ADD TO THE PLEA 
SURE OF DECEIVING ME IF IT REALLY WERE TRUE YES IF IT WERE 
TRUE BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO AND CANT 
BELIEVE IT HE REMEMBERED THE EXPRESSION DOLOKHOVS FACE 
ASSUMED IN HIS MOMENTS OF CRUELTY AS WHEN TYING THE PO 
LICEMAN TO THE BEAR AND DROPPING THEM INTO THE WATER OR 
WHEN HE CHALLENGED A MAN TO A DUEL WITHOUT ANY REASON OR 
SHOT A POSTBOYS HORSE WITH A PISTOL THAT EXPRESSION WAS 
OFTEN ON DOLOKHOVS FACE WHEN LOOKING AT HIM YES HE IS A 
BULLY THOUGHT PIERRE TO KILL A MAN MEANS NOTHING TO HIM 
IT MUST SEEM TO HIM THAT EVERYONE IS AFRAID OF HIM AND THAT 
MUST PLEASE HIM HE MUST THINK THAT I TOO AM AFRAID OF 
HIMAND IN FACT I AM AFRAID OF HIM HE THOUGHT AND AGAIN

HE GLANCED IRONICALLY AT PIERRE WHOSE PREOCCUPIED ABSENT
MINDED AND MASSIVE FIGURE WAS A VERY NOTICEABLE ONE AT 
THE DINNER ROSTOV LOOKED INIMICALLY AT PIERRE FIRST BECAUSE 
PIERRE APPEARED TO HIS HUSSAR EYES AS A RICH CIVILIAN THE HUS 
BAND OF A BEAUTY AND IN A WORDAN OLD WOMAN AND SECONDLY 
BECAUSE PIERRE IN HIS PREOCCUPATION AND ABSENTMINDEDNESS 
HAD NOT RECOGNIZED ROSTOV AND HAD NOT RESPONDED TO HIS 
GREETING WHEN THE EMPERORS HEALTH WAS DRUNK PIERRE 
LOST IN THOUGHT DID NOT RISE OR LIFT HIS GLASS

SEVEN OF HEARTS MEANT FOR HIM NOT ONLY THE LOSS OF SIXTEEN 
HUNDRED RUBLES BUT THE NECESSITY OF GOING BACK ON HIS WORD

GLANCE AT ROSTOV AS HE CONTINUED TO DEAL FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER XIV
AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER MOST OF THE PLAYERS WERE BUT LITTLE 
INTERESTED IN THEIR OWN PLAY
THE WHOLE INTEREST WAS CONCENTRATED ON ROSTOV IN 
STEAD OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED RUBLES HE HAD A LONG COLUMN OF 
FIGURES SCORED AGAINST HIM WHICH HE HAD RECKONED UP TO 
TEN THOUSAND BUT THAT NOW AS HE VAGUELY SUPPOSED MUST 
HAVE RISEN TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND IN REALITY IT ALREADY EXCEEDED 
TWENTY THOUSAND RUBLES DOLOKHOV WAS NO LONGER LISTEN 
ING TO STORIES OR TELLING THEM BUT FOLLOWED EVERY MOVEMENT 
OF ROSTOVS HANDS AND OCCASIONALLY RAN HIS EYES OVER THE 
SCORE AGAINST HIM HE HAD DECIDED TO PLAY UNTIL THAT SCORE 
REACHED FORTYTHREE THOUSAND HE HAD FIXED ON THAT NUM 
BER BECAUSE FORTYTHREE WAS THE SUM OF HIS AND SONYAS JOINT 
AGES ROSTOV LEANING HIS HEAD ON BOTH HANDS SAT AT THE TA 
BLE WHICH WAS SCRAWLED OVER WITH FIGURES WET WITH SPILLED 
WINE AND LITTERED WITH CARDS ONE TORMENTING IMPRESSION

SUM BUT DOLOKHOV REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT AND FIXED THE STAKE WAR AND PEACE HIMSELF NICHOLAS SUBMITTED TO HIM AND AT ONE MOMENT 
PRAYED TO GOD AS HE HAD DONE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AT THE BRIDGE 
OVER THE ENNS AND THEN GUESSED THAT THE CARD THAT CAME 
FIRST TO HAND FROM THE CRUMPLED HEAP UNDER THE TABLE WOULD 
SAVE HIM NOW COUNTED THE CORDS ON HIS COAT AND TOOK A CARD 
WITH THAT NUMBER AND TRIED STAKING THE TOTAL OF HIS LOSSES ON 
IT THEN HE LOOKED ROUND FOR AID FROM THE OTHER PLAYERS OR 
PEERED AT THE NOW COLD FACE OF DOLOKHOV AND TRIED TO READ 
WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS MIND
HE KNOWS OF COURSE WHAT THIS LOSS MEANS TO ME HE CANT 
WANT MY RUIN WASNT HE MY FRIEND WASNT I FOND OF HIM 
BUT ITS NOT HIS FAULT WHATS HE TO DO IF HE HAS SUCH LUCK

THING HE HAD BEGUN TO THINK OF THE LAST STATION AND WAS STILL 
PONDERING ON THE SAME QUESTIONONE SO IMPORTANT THAT HE 
TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT WENT ON AROUND HIM NOT ONLY WAS 
HE INDIFFERENT AS TO WHETHER HE GOT TO PETERSBURG EARLIER OR 
LATER OR WHETHER HE SECURED ACCOMMODATION AT THIS STATION 
BUT COMPARED TO THE THOUGHTS THAT NOW OCCUPIED HIM IT WAS 
A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE WHETHER HE REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW 
HOURS OR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
THE POSTMASTER HIS WIFE THE VALET AND A PEASANT WOM 
AN SELLING TORZHOK EMBROIDERY CAME INTO THE ROOM OFFERING

THE JOURNEY THEY SEIZED HIM WITH SPECIAL FORCE NO MATTER 
WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT HE ALWAYS RETURNED TO THESE SAME 
QUESTIONS WHICH HE COULD NOT SOLVE AND YET COULD NOT CEASE

ME BAD FOR ANOTHER TRAVELER AND FOR HIMSELF ITS UNAVOID 
ABLE BECAUSE HE NEEDS MONEY FOR FOOD THE MAN SAID AN 
OFFICER HAD ONCE GIVEN HIM A THRASHING FOR LETTING A PRIVATE 
TRAVELER HAVE THE COURIER HORSES BUT THE OFFICER THRASHED 
HIM BECAUSE HE HAD TO GET ON AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND

COMPLEX SENSATIONS HE FELT AFRAID OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO 
HIM AND STILL MORE AFRAID OF SHOWING HIS FEAR HE FELT CURI 
OUS TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHAT WOULD BE

REGENERATION AND ON THE ACTIVELY VIRTUOUS LIFE OF WHICH HE 
HAD BEEN DREAMING SINCE HE MET JOSEPH ALEXEEVICH LOUD 
KNOCKS WERE HEARD AT THE DOOR PIERRE TOOK THE BANDAGE OFF  
HIS EYES AND GLANCED AROUND HIM THE ROOM WAS IN BLACK 
DARKNESS ONLY A SMALL LAMP WAS BURNING INSIDE SOMETHING 
WHITE PIERRE WENT NEARER AND SAW THAT THE LAMP STOOD ON A  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMBLACK TABLE ON WHICH LAY AN OPEN BOOK THE BOOK WAS THE 
GOSPEL AND THE WHITE THING WITH THE LAMP INSIDE WAS A HU 
MAN SKULL WITH ITS CAVITIES AND TEETH AFTER READING THE FIRST 
WORDS OF THE GOSPEL IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD AND 
THE WORD WAS WITH GOD PIERRE WENT ROUND THE TABLE AND 
SAW A LARGE OPEN BOX FILLED WITH SOMETHING IT WAS A COFFIN 
WITH BONES INSIDE HE WAS NOT AT ALL SURPRISED BY WHAT HE 
SAW HOPING TO ENTER ON AN ENTIRELY NEW LIFE QUITE UNLIKE THE 
OLD ONE HE EXPECTED EVERYTHING TO BE UNUSUAL EVEN MORE 
UNUSUAL THAN WHAT HE WAS SEEING A SKULL A COFFIN THE GOS 
PELIT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD EXPECTED ALL THIS AND EVEN 
MORE TRYING TO STIMULATE HIS EMOTIONS HE LOOKED AROUND 
GOD DEATH LOVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN HE KEPT SAYING 
TO HIMSELF ASSOCIATING THESE WORDS WITH VAGUE YET JOYFUL 
IDEAS THE DOOR OPENED AND SOMEONE CAME IN
BY THE DIM LIGHT TO WHICH PIERRE HAD ALREADY BECOME AC 
CUSTOMED HE SAW RATHER SHORT MAN HAVING EVIDENTLY COME 
FROM THE LIGHT INTO THE DARKNESS THE MAN PAUSED THEN 
MOVED WITH CAUTIOUS STEPS TOWARD THE TABLE AND PLACED ON IT 
HIS SMALL LEATHERGLOVED HANDS
THIS SHORT MAN HAD ON A WHITE LEATHER APRON WHICH 
COVERED HIS CHEST AND PART OF HIS LEGS HE HAD ON A KIND OF 
NECKLACE ABOVE WHICH ROSE A HIGH WHITE RUFFLE OUTLINING HIS

EXPERIENCED IN HIS BOYHOOD AT CONFESSION HE FELT HIMSELF 
IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE SOCIALLY A COMPLETE STRANGER YET 
NEARER TO HIM THROUGH THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN WITH BAT 
ED BREATH AND BEATING HEART HE MOVED TOWARD THE RHETOR 
BY WHICH NAME THE BROTHER WHO PREPARED A SEEKER FOR EN 
TRANCE INTO THE BROTHERHOOD WAS KNOWN DRAWING NEARER 
HE RECOGNIZED IN THE RHETOR A MAN HE KNEW SMOLYANINOV 
AND IT MORTIFIED HIM TO THINK THAT THE NEWCOMER WAS AN AC 
QUAINTANCEHE WISHED HIM SIMPLY A BROTHER AND A VIRTUOUS 
INSTRUCTOR FOR A LONG TIME HE COULD NOT UTTER A WORD SO THAT 
THE RHETOR HAD TO REPEAT HIS QUESTION

FICULTY
VERY WELL SAID SMOLYANINOV AND WENT ON AT ONCE HAVE 
YOU ANY IDEA OF THE MEANS BY WHICH OUR HOLY ORDER WILL HELP 
YOU TO REACH YOUR AIM SAID HE QUIETLY AND QUICKLY
I HOPE FOR GUIDANCE HELP IN REGENERATION SAID 
PIERRE WITH A TREMBLING VOICE AND SOME DIFFICULTY IN UTTER 
ANCE DUE TO HIS EXCITEMENT AND TO BEING UNACCUSTOMED TO 
SPEAK OF ABSTRACT MATTERS IN RUSSIAN
WHAT IS YOUR CONCEPTION OF FREEMASONRY
I IMAGINE THAT FREEMASONRY IS THE FRATERNITY AND EQUAL 
ITY OF MEN WHO HAVE VIRTUOUS AIMS SAID PIERRE FEELING 
ASHAMED OF THE INADEQUACY OF HIS WORDS FOR THE SOLEMNITY 
OF THE MOMENT AS HE SPOKE I IMAGINE

THIS ANSWER HAVE YOU SOUGHT FOR MEANS OF ATTAINING YOUR  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMAIM IN RELIGION
NO I CONSIDERED IT ERRONEOUS AND DID NOT FOLLOW IT SAID 
PIERRE SO SOFTLY THAT THE RHETOR DID NOT HEAR HIM AND ASKED 
HIM WHAT HE WAS SAYING I HAVE BEEN AN ATHEIST ANSWERED 
PIERRE
YOU ARE SEEKING FOR TRUTH IN ORDER TO FOLLOW ITS LAWS IN 
YOUR LIFE THEREFORE YOU SEEK WISDOM AND VIRTUE IS THAT NOT 
SO SAID THE RHETOR AFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE
YES YES ASSENTED PIERRE
THE RHETOR CLEARED HIS THROAT CROSSED HIS GLOVED HANDS 
ON HIS BREAST AND BEGAN TO SPEAK
NOW I MUST DISCLOSE TO YOU THE CHIEF AIM OF OUR ORDER 
HE SAID AND IF THIS AIM COINCIDES WITH YOURS YOU MAY EN 
TER OUR BROTHERHOOD WITH PROFIT THE FIRST AND CHIEF OBJECT OF 
OUR ORDER THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH IT RESTS AND WHICH NO 
HUMAN POWER CAN DESTROY IS THE PRESERVATION AND HAND 
ING ON TO POSTERITY OF A CERTAIN IMPORTANT MYSTERY WHICH 
HAS COME DOWN TO US FROM THE REMOTEST AGES EVEN FROM THE 
FIRST MANA MYSTERY ON WHICH PERHAPS THE FATE OF MANKIND 
DEPENDS BUT SINCE THIS MYSTERY IS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT NO 
BODY CAN KNOW OR USE IT UNLESS HE BE PREPARED BY LONG AND 
DILIGENT SELFPURIFICATION NOT EVERYONE CAN HOPE TO ATTAIN IT 
QUICKLY HENCE WE HAVE A SECONDARY AIM THAT OF PREPARING 
OUR MEMBERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO REFORM THEIR HEARTS TO 
PURIFY AND ENLIGHTEN THEIR MINDS BY MEANS HANDED ON TO US 
BY TRADITION FROM THOSE WHO HAVE STRIVEN TO ATTAIN THIS MYS 
TERY AND THEREBY TO RENDER THEM CAPABLE OF RECEIVING IT
BY PURIFYING AND REGENERATING OUR MEMBERS WE TRY 
THIRDLY TO IMPROVE THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE OFFERING IT IN WAR AND PEACE OUR MEMBERS AN EXAMPLE OF PIETY AND VIRTUE AND THEREBY 
TRY WITH ALL OUR MIGHT TO COMBAT THE EVIL WHICH SWAYS THE 
WORLD THINK THIS OVER AND I WILL COME TO YOU AGAIN
TO COMBAT THE EVIL WHICH SWAYS THE WORLD PIERRE RE 
PEATED AND A MENTAL IMAGE OF HIS FUTURE ACTIVITY IN THIS 
DIRECTION ROSE IN HIS MIND HE IMAGINED MEN SUCH AS HE 
HAD HIMSELF BEEN A FORTNIGHT AGO AND HE ADDRESSED AN EDI 
FYING EXHORTATION TO THEM HE IMAGINED TO HIMSELF VICIOUS 
AND UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WHOM HE WOULD ASSIST BY WORD AND 
DEED IMAGINED OPPRESSORS WHOSE VICTIMS HE WOULD RES 
CUE OF THE THREE OBJECTS MENTIONED BY THE RHETOR THIS LAST 
THAT OF IMPROVING MANKIND ESPECIALLY APPEALED TO PIERRE 
THE IMPORTANT MYSTERY MENTIONED BY THE RHETOR THOUGH 
IT AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY DID NOT SEEM TO HIM ESSENTIAL AND 
THE SECOND AIM THAT OF PURIFYING AND REGENERATING HIMSELF 
DID NOT MUCH INTEREST HIM BECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT HE FELT 
WITH DELIGHT THAT HE WAS ALREADY PERFECTLY CURED OF HIS FOR 
MER FAULTS AND WAS READY FOR ALL THAT WAS GOOD
HALF AN HOUR LATER THE RHETOR RETURNED TO INFORM THE 
SEEKER OF THE SEVEN VIRTUES CORRESPONDING TO THE SEVEN 
STEPS OF SOLOMONS TEMPLE WHICH EVERY FREEMASON SHOULD 
CULTIVATE IN HIMSELF THESE VIRTUES WERE  DISCRETION THE 
KEEPING OF THE SECRETS OF THE ORDER  OBEDIENCE TO THOSE OF 
HIGHER RANKS IN THE ORDER  MORALITY  LOVE OF MANKIND 
 COURAGE  GENEROSITY  THE LOVE OF DEATH
IN THE SEVENTH PLACE TRY BY THE FREQUENT THOUGHT OF 
DEATH THE RHETOR SAID TO BRING YOURSELF TO REGARD IT NOT AS 
A DREADED FOE BUT AS A FRIEND THAT FREES THE SOUL GROWN WEA 
RY IN THE LABORS OF VIRTUE FROM THIS DISTRESSFUL LIFE AND LEADS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMIT TO ITS PLACE OF RECOMPENSE AND PEACE
YES THAT MUST BE SO THOUGHT PIERRE WHEN AFTER THESE 
WORDS THE RHETOR WENT AWAY LEAVING HIM TO SOLITARY MEDI 
TATION IT MUST BE SO BUT I AM STILL SO WEAK THAT I LOVE MY 
LIFE THE MEANING OF WHICH IS ONLY NOW GRADUALLY OPENING 
BEFORE ME BUT FIVE OF THE OTHER VIRTUES WHICH PIERRE RE 
CALLED COUNTING THEM ON HIS FINGERS HE FELT ALREADY IN HIS 
SOUL COURAGE GENEROSITY MORALITY LOVE OF MANKIND AND 
ESPECIALLY OBEDIENCEWHICH DID NOT EVEN SEEM TO HIM A VIR 
TUE BUT A JOY HE NOW FELT SO GLAD TO BE FREE FROM HIS OWN 
LAWLESSNESS AND TO SUBMIT HIS WILL TO THOSE WHO KNEW THE 
INDUBITABLE TRUTH HE FORGOT WHAT THE SEVENTH VIRTUE WAS 
AND COULD NOT RECALL IT
THE THIRD TIME THE RHETOR CAME BACK MORE QUICKLY AND 
ASKED PIERRE WHETHER HE WAS STILL FIRM IN HIS INTENTION AND 
DETERMINED TO SUBMIT TO ALL THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HIM
I AM READY FOR EVERYTHING SAID PIERRE
I MUST ALSO INFORM YOU SAID THE RHETOR THAT OUR OR 
DER DELIVERS ITS TEACHING NOT IN WORDS ONLY BUT ALSO BY OTHER 
MEANS WHICH MAY PERHAPS HAVE A STRONGER EFFECT ON THE SIN 
CERE SEEKER AFTER WISDOM AND VIRTUE THAN MERE WORDS THIS 
CHAMBER WITH WHAT YOU SEE THEREIN SHOULD ALREADY HAVE 
SUGGESTED TO YOUR HEART IF IT IS SINCERE MORE THAN WORDS 
COULD DO YOU WILL PERHAPS ALSO SEE IN YOUR FURTHER INITIA 
TION A LIKE METHOD OF ENLIGHTENMENT OUR ORDER IMITATES 
THE ANCIENT SOCIETIES THAT EXPLAINED THEIR TEACHING BY HIERO 
GLYPHICS A HIEROGLYPH SAID THE RHETOR IS AN EMBLEM OF 
SOMETHING NOT COGNIZABLE BY THE SENSES BUT WHICH POSSESSES 
QUALITIES RESEMBLING THOSE OF THE SYMBOLWAR AND PEACE PIERRE KNEW VERY WELL WHAT A HIEROGLYPH WAS BUT DARED 
NOT SPEAK HE LISTENED TO THE RHETOR IN SILENCE FEELING FROM 
ALL HE SAID THAT HIS ORDEAL WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN
IF YOU ARE RESOLVED I MUST BEGIN YOUR INITIATION SAID THE 
RHETOR COMING CLOSER TO PIERRE IN TOKEN OF GENEROSITY I ASK 
YOU TO GIVE ME ALL YOUR VALUABLES
BUT I HAVE NOTHING HERE REPLIED PIERRE SUPPOSING THAT 
HE WAS ASKED TO GIVE UP ALL HE POSSESSED
WHAT YOU HAVE WITH YOU WATCH MONEY RINGS
PIERRE QUICKLY TOOK OUT HIS PURSE AND WATCH BUT COULD 
NOT MANAGE FOR SOME TIME TO GET THE WEDDING RING OFF HIS FAT 
FINGER WHEN THAT HAD BEEN DONE THE RHETOR SAID
IN TOKEN OF OBEDIENCE I ASK YOU TO UNDRESS
PIERRE TOOK OFF HIS COAT WAISTCOAT AND LEFT BOOT ACCORD 
ING TO THE RHETORS INSTRUCTIONS THE MASON DREW THE SHIRT 
BACK FROM PIERRES LEFT BREAST AND STOOPING DOWN PULLED UP 
THE LEFT LEG OF HIS TROUSERS TO ABOVE THE KNEE PIERRE HURRIEDLY 
BEGAN TAKING OFF HIS RIGHT BOOT ALSO AND WAS GOING TO TUCK 
UP THE OTHER TROUSER LEG TO SAVE THIS STRANGER THE TROUBLE BUT 
THE MASON TOLD HIM THAT WAS NOT NECESSARY AND GAVE HIM A 
SLIPPER FOR HIS LEFT FOOT WITH A CHILDLIKE SMILE OF EMBARRASS 
MENT DOUBT AND SELFDERISION WHICH APPEARED ON HIS FACE 
AGAINST HIS WILL PIERRE STOOD WITH HIS ARMS HANGING DOWN 
AND LEGS APART BEFORE HIS BROTHER RHETOR AND AWAITED HIS 
FURTHER COMMANDS
AND NOW IN TOKEN OF CANDOR I ASK YOU TO REVEAL TO ME 
YOUR CHIEF PASSION SAID THE LATTER
MY PASSION I HAVE HAD SO MANY REPLIED PIERRE
THAT PASSION WHICH MORE THAN ALL OTHERS CAUSED YOU TO  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWAVER ON THE PATH OF VIRTUE SAID THE MASON
PIERRE PAUSED SEEKING A REPLY
WINE GLUTTONY IDLENESS LAZINESS IRRITABILITY ANGER 
WOMEN HE WENT OVER HIS VICES IN HIS MIND NOT KNOWING 
TO WHICH OF THEM TO GIVE THE PREEMINENCE
WOMEN HE SAID IN A LOW SCARCELY AUDIBLE VOICE
THE MASON DID NOT MOVE AND FOR A LONG TIME SAID NOTHING 
AFTER THIS ANSWER AT LAST HE MOVED UP TO PIERRE AND TAKING 
THE KERCHIEF THAT LAY ON THE TABLE AGAIN BOUND HIS EYES
FOR THE LAST TIME I SAY TO YOUTURN ALL YOUR ATTENTION UPON 
YOURSELF PUT A BRIDLE ON YOUR SENSES AND SEEK BLESSEDNESS 
NOT IN PASSION BUT IN YOUR OWN HEART THE SOURCE OF BLESSED 
NESS IS NOT WITHOUT US BUT WITHIN
PIERRE HAD ALREADY LONG BEEN FEELING IN HIMSELF THAT RE 
FRESHING SOURCE OF BLESSEDNESS WHICH NOW FLOODED HIS HEART 
WITH GLAD EMOTIONWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER IV
SOON AFTER THIS THERE CAME INTO THE DARK CHAMBER TO FETCH 
PIERRE NOT THE RHETOR BUT PIERRES SPONSOR WILLARSKI WHOM 
HE RECOGNIZED BY HIS VOICE TO FRESH QUESTIONS AS TO THE FIRM 
NESS OF HIS RESOLUTION PIERRE REPLIED YES YES I AGREE AND 
WITH A BEAMING CHILDLIKE SMILE HIS FAT CHEST UNCOVERED 
STEPPING UNEVENLY AND TIMIDLY IN ONE SLIPPERED AND ONE 
BOOTED FOOT HE ADVANCED WHILE WILLARSKI HELD A SWORD TO

ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF THE COURAGE WITH WHICH 
HE SHOULD ENDURE TOILS AND DANGERS DURING THESE WAN 
DERINGS PIERRE NOTICED THAT HE WAS SPOKEN OF NOW AS THE 
SEEKER NOW AS THE SUFFERER AND NOW AS THE POSTULANT TO 
THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF VARIOUS KNOCKINGS WITH MALLETS AND

THAT THEY TOOK HIS RIGHT HAND PLACED IT ON SOMETHING AND 
TOLD HIM TO HOLD A PAIR OF COMPASSES TO HIS LEFT BREAST WITH 
THE OTHER HAND AND TO REPEAT AFTER SOMEONE WHO READ ALOUD 
AN OATH OF FIDELITY TO THE LAWS OF THE ORDER THE CANDLES WERE 
THEN EXTINGUISHED AND SOME SPIRIT LIGHTED AS PIERRE KNEW 
BY THE SMELL AND HE WAS TOLD THAT HE WOULD NOW SEE THE LESS

LIGHT OF THE BURNING SPIRIT PIERRE AS IN A DREAM SAW SEVERAL 
MEN STANDING BEFORE HIM WEARING APRONS LIKE THE RHETORS 
AND HOLDING SWORDS IN THEIR HANDS POINTED AT HIS BREAST 
AMONG THEM STOOD A MAN WHOSE WHITE SHIRT WAS STAINED 
WITH BLOOD ON SEEING THIS PIERRE MOVED FORWARD WITH HIS 
BREAST TOWARD THE SWORDS MEANING THEM TO PIERCE IT BUT 
THE SWORDS WERE DRAWN BACK FROM HIM AND HE WAS AT ONCE

THE DAY AFTER HE HAD BEEN RECEIVED INTO THE LODGE PIERRE 
WAS SITTING AT HOME READING A BOOK AND TRYING TO FATHOM 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SQUARE ONE SIDE OF WHICH SYMBOL 
IZED GOD ANOTHER MORAL THINGS A THIRD PHYSICAL THINGS 
AND THE FOURTH A COMBINATION OF THESE NOW AND THEN HIS 
ATTENTION WANDERED FROM THE BOOK AND THE SQUARE AND HE 
FORMED IN IMAGINATION A NEW PLAN OF LIFE ON THE PREVIOUS 
EVENING AT THE LODGE HE HAD HEARD THAT A RUMOR OF HIS DUEL 
HAD REACHED THE EMPEROR AND THAT IT WOULD BE WISER FOR HIM 
TO LEAVE PETERSBURG PIERRE PROPOSED GOING TO HIS ESTATES IN

FRIEND I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND UNDERSTAND IT ALL HE SAID

MISUNDERSTANDING I EXPECT YOU FEEL IT SO YOURSELF LET US

PRINCE VASILI GAVE PIERRE A SIGNIFICANT LOOK
I KNOW FROM RELIABLE SOURCES THAT THE DOWAGER EMPRESS 
IS TAKING A KEEN INTEREST IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU KNOW SHE IS 
VERY GRACIOUS TO HELENE
PIERRE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO SPEAK BUT ON ONE HAND 
PRINCE VASILI DID NOT LET HIM AND ON THE OTHER PIERRE HIM 
SELF FEARED TO BEGIN TO SPEAK IN THE TONE OF DECIDED REFUSAL 
AND DISAGREEMENT IN WHICH HE HAD FIRMLY RESOLVED TO AN 
SWER HIS FATHERINLAW MOREOVER THE WORDS OF THE MASONIC 
STATUTES BE KINDLY AND COURTEOUS RECURRED TO HIM HE

EDWHETHER HE WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME OLD ROAD OR THAT NEW 
PATH SO ATTRACTIVELY SHOWN HIM BY THE MASONS ON WHICH HE 
FIRMLY BELIEVED HE WOULD BE REBORN TO A NEW LIFE
NOW DEAR BOY SAID PRINCE VASILI PLAYFULLY SAY YES WAR AND PEACE AND ILL WRITE TO HER MYSELF AND WE WILL KILL THE FATTED CALF
BUT BEFORE PRINCE VASILI HAD FINISHED HIS PLAYFUL SPEECH 
PIERRE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM AND WITH A KIND OF FURY THAT 
MADE HIM LIKE HIS FATHER MUTTERED IN A WHISPER
PRINCE I DID NOT ASK YOU HERE GO PLEASE GO AND HE 
JUMPED UP AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM

A SHADE OF DEFERENCE DUE TO HER MISFORTUNE WHEN CONVER 
SATION TURNED ON HER HUSBAND HELENE ASSUMED A DIGNIFIED 
EXPRESSION WHICH WITH CHARACTERISTIC TACT SHE HAD ACQUIRED 
THOUGH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND ITS SIGNIFICANCE THIS EXPRES 
SION SUGGESTED THAT SHE HAD RESOLVED TO ENDURE HER TROUBLES 
UNCOMPLAININGLY AND THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A CROSS LAID

WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO PLEASED AT OLMUTZ AND ACCORDING TO 
WHICH AN ENSIGN MIGHT RANK INCOMPARABLY HIGHER THAN A 
GENERAL AND ACCORDING TO WHICH WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR SUC 
CESS IN THE SERVICE WAS NOT EFFORT OR WORK OR COURAGE OR 
PERSEVERANCE BUT ONLY THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO GET ON WITH 
THOSE WHO CAN GRANT REWARDS AND HE WAS HIMSELF OFTEN SUR 
PRISED AT THE RAPIDITY OF HIS SUCCESS AND AT THE INABILITY OF 
OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS 
DISCOVERY HIS WHOLE MANNER OF LIFE ALL HIS RELATIONS WITH 
OLD FRIENDS ALL HIS PLANS FOR HIS FUTURE WERE COMPLETELY AL 
TERED HE WAS NOT RICH BUT WOULD SPEND HIS LAST GROAT TO BE 
BETTER DRESSED THAN OTHERS AND WOULD RATHER DEPRIVE HIM

AND HE AT ONCE UNDERSTOOD HIS ROLE LETTING HIS HOSTESS MAKE 
USE OF WHATEVER INTEREST HE HAD TO OFFER HE HIMSELF CAREFULLY 
SCANNED EACH FACE APPRAISING THE POSSIBILITIES OF ESTABLISH 
ING INTIMACY WITH EACH OF THOSE PRESENT AND THE ADVANTAGES 
THAT MIGHT ACCRUE HE TOOK THE SEAT INDICATED TO HIM BESIDE 
THE FAIR HELENE AND LISTENED TO THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
VIENNA CONSIDERS THE BASES OF THE PROPOSED TREATY SO 
UNATTAINABLE THAT NOT EVEN A CONTINUITY OF MOST BRILLIANT

HAVE OF GAINING THEM THAT IS THE ACTUAL PHRASE USED BY THE

EVERYWHERE ONE HEARD CURSES ON BONAPARTE THE ENEMY OF 
MANKIND MILITIAMEN AND RECRUITS WERE BEING ENROLLED IN 
THE VILLAGES AND FROM THE SEAT OF WAR CAME CONTRADICTORY 
NEWS FALSE AS USUAL AND THEREFORE VARIOUSLY INTERPRETED THE 
LIFE OF OLD PRINCE BOLKONSKI PRINCE ANDREW AND PRINCESS 
MARY HAD GREATLY CHANGED SINCE 
IN  THE OLD PRINCE WAS MADE ONE OF THE EIGHT COM 
MANDERS IN CHIEF THEN APPOINTED TO SUPERVISE THE ENROLLMENT 
DECREED THROUGHOUT RUSSIA DESPITE THE WEAKNESS OF AGE 
WHICH HAD BECOME PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE SINCE THE TIME 
WHEN HE THOUGHT HIS SON HAD BEEN KILLED HE DID NOT THINK IT 
RIGHT TO REFUSE A DUTY TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY THE 
EMPEROR HIMSELF AND THIS FRESH OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTION GAVE 
HIM NEW ENERGY AND STRENGTH HE WAS CONTINUALLY TRAVELING 
THROUGH THE THREE PROVINCES ENTRUSTED TO HIM WAS PEDAN 
TIC IN THE FULFILLMENT OF HIS DUTIES SEVERE TO CRUELTY WITH HIS 
SUBORDINATES AND WENT INTO EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE MINUT

WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO ME
SOON AFTER PRINCE ANDREWS RETURN THE OLD PRINCE MADE 
OVER TO HIM A LARGE ESTATE BOGUCHAROVO ABOUT TWENTYFIVE 
MILES FROM BALD HILLS PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE DEPRESSING 
MEMORIES ASSOCIATED WITH BALD HILLS PARTLY BECAUSE PRINCE

RESOLVED NOT TO CONTINUE HIS MILITARY SERVICE AND WHEN THE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWAR RECOMMENCED AND EVERYBODY HAD TO SERVE HE TOOK A

ELSE FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER IX
BILIBIN WAS NOW AT ARMY HEADQUARTERS IN A DIPLOMATIC CA 
PACITY AND THOUGH HE WROTE IN FRENCH AND USED FRENCH JESTS 
AND FRENCH IDIOMS HE DESCRIBED THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN WITH 
A FEARLESS SELFCENSURE AND SELFDERISION GENUINELY RUSSIAN 
BILIBIN WROTE THAT THE OBLIGATION OF DIPLOMATIC DISCRETION 
TORMENTED HIM AND HE WAS HAPPY TO HAVE IN PRINCE ANDREW 
A RELIABLE CORRESPONDENT TO WHOM HE COULD POUR OUT THE BILE 
HE HAD ACCUMULATED AT THE SIGHT OF ALL THAT WAS BEING DONE 
IN THE ARMY THE LETTER WAS OLD HAVING BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE 
THE BATTLE AT PREUSSISCHEYLAU
SINCE THE DAY OF OUR BRILLIANT SUCCESS AT AUSTERLITZ WROTE 
BILIBIN AS YOU KNOW MY DEAR PRINCE I NEVER LEAVE HEAD 
QUARTERS I HAVE CERTAINLY ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR WAR AND IT IS 
JUST AS WELL FOR ME WHAT I HAVE SEEN DURING THESE LAST THREE 
MONTHS IS INCREDIBLE
I BEGIN AB OVO THE ENEMY OF THE HUMAN RACE AS YOU 
KNOW ATTACKS THE PRUSSIANS THE PRUSSIANS ARE OUR FAITHFUL 
ALLIES WHO HAVE ONLY BETRAYED US THREE TIMES IN THREE YEARS 
WE TAKE UP THEIR CAUSE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ENEMY OF 
THE HUMAN RACE PAYS NO HEED TO OUR FINE SPEECHES AND IN HIS 
RUDE AND SAVAGE WAY THROWS HIMSELF ON THE PRUSSIANS WITH 
OUT GIVING THEM TIME TO FINISH THE PARADE THEY HAD BEGUN 
AND IN TWO TWISTS OF THE HAND HE BREAKS THEM TO SMITHEREENS 
AND INSTALLS HIMSELF IN THE PALACE AT POTSDAMWAR AND PEACE I MOST ARDENTLY DESIRE WRITES THE KING OF PRUSSIA TO 
BONAPARTE THAT YOUR MAJESTY SHOULD BE RECEIVED AND TREAT 
ED IN MY PALACE IN A MANNER AGREEABLE TO YOURSELF AND IN 
SO FAR AS CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED I HAVE HASTENED TO TAKE ALL 
STEPS TO THAT END MAY I HAVE SUCCEEDED THE PRUSSIAN GEN 
ERALS PRIDE THEMSELVES ON BEING POLITE TO THE FRENCH AND LAY 
DOWN THEIR ARMS AT THE FIRST DEMAND
THE HEAD OF THE GARRISON AT GLOGAU WITH TEN THOUSAND 
MEN ASKS THE KING OF PRUSSIA WHAT HE IS TO DO IF HE IS SUM 
MONED TO SURRENDER ALL THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE
IN SHORT HOPING TO SETTLE MATTERS BY TAKING UP A WARLIKE 
ATTITUDE IT TURNS OUT THAT WE HAVE LANDED OURSELVES IN WAR 
AND WHAT IS MORE IN WAR ON OUR OWN FRONTIERS WITH AND 
FOR THE KING OF PRUSSIA WE HAVE EVERYTHING IN PERFECT OR 
DER ONLY ONE LITTLE THING IS LACKING NAMELY A COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF AS IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT THE AUSTERLITZ SUCCESS MIGHT 
HAVE BEEN MORE DECISIVE HAD THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF NOT 
BEEN SO YOUNG ALL OUR OCTOGENARIANS WERE REVIEWED AND 
OF PROZOROVSKI AND KAMENSKI THE LATTER WAS PREFERRED THE 
GENERAL COMES TO US SUVOROVLIKE IN A KIBITKA AND IS RE 
CEIVED WITH ACCLAMATIONS OF JOY AND TRIUMPH
ON THE TH THE FIRST COURIER ARRIVES FROM PETERSBURG 
THE MAILS ARE TAKEN TO THE FIELD MARSHALS ROOM FOR HE LIKES 
TO DO EVERYTHING HIMSELF I AM CALLED IN TO HELP SORT THE LET 
TERS AND TAKE THOSE MEANT FOR US THE FIELD MARSHAL LOOKS 
ON AND WAITS FOR LETTERS ADDRESSED TO HIM WE SEARCH BUT 
NONE ARE TO BE FOUND THE FIELD MARSHAL GROWS IMPATIENT AND 
SETS TO WORK HIMSELF AND FINDS LETTERS FROM THE EMPEROR TO 
COUNT T PRINCE V AND OTHERS THEN HE BURSTS INTO ONE OF  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHIS WILD FURIES AND RAGES AT EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING SEIZES 
THE LETTERS OPENS THEM AND READS THOSE FROM THE EMPEROR 
ADDRESSED TO OTHERS AH SO THATS THE WAY THEY TREAT ME NO 
CONFIDENCE IN ME AH ORDERED TO KEEP AN EYE ON ME VERY 
WELL THEN GET ALONG WITH YOU SO HE WRITES THE FAMOUS OR 
DER OF THE DAY TO GENERAL BENNIGSEN
I AM WOUNDED AND CANNOT RIDE AND CONSEQUENTLY CAN 
NOT COMMAND THE ARMY YOU HAVE BROUGHT YOUR ARMY CORPS 
TO PULTUSK ROUTED HERE IT IS EXPOSED AND WITHOUT FUEL OR 
FORAGE SO SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND AS YOU YOURSELF RE 
PORTED TO COUNT BUXHOWDEN YESTERDAY YOU MUST THINK OF 
RETREATING TO OUR FRONTIERWHICH DO TODAY
FROM ALL MY RIDING HE WRITES TO THE EMPEROR I HAVE 
GOT A SADDLE SORE WHICH COMING AFTER ALL MY PREVIOUS JOUR 
NEYS QUITE PREVENTS MY RIDING AND COMMANDING SO VAST AN 
ARMY SO I HAVE PASSED ON THE COMMAND TO THE GENERAL NEXT 
IN SENIORITY COUNT BUXHOWDEN HAVING SENT HIM MY WHOLE 
STAFF AND ALL THAT BELONGS TO IT ADVISING HIM IF THERE IS A LACK 
OF BREAD TO MOVE FARTHER INTO THE INTERIOR OF PRUSSIA FOR 
ONLY ONE DAYS RATION OF BREAD REMAINS AND IN SOME REGI 
MENTS NONE AT ALL AS REPORTED BY THE DIVISION COMMANDERS 
OSTERMANN AND SEDMORETZKI AND ALL THAT THE PEASANTS HAD 
HAS BEEN EATEN UP I MYSELF WILL REMAIN IN HOSPITAL AT OS 
TROLENKA TILL I RECOVER IN REGARD TO WHICH I HUMBLY SUBMIT 
MY REPORT WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IF THE ARMY REMAINS 
IN ITS PRESENT BIVOUAC ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THERE WILL NOT BE A 
HEALTHY MAN LEFT IN IT BY SPRING
GRANT LEAVE TO RETIRE TO HIS COUNTRY SEAT TO AN OLD MAN 
WHO IS ALREADY IN ANY CASE DISHONORED BY BEING UNABLE TO WAR AND PEACE FULFILL THE GREAT AND GLORIOUS TASK FOR WHICH HE WAS CHOSEN 
I SHALL AWAIT YOUR MOST GRACIOUS PERMISSION HERE IN HOSPI 
TAL THAT I MAY NOT HAVE TO PLAY THE PART OF A SECRETARY RATHER 
THAN COMMANDER IN THE ARMY MY REMOVAL FROM THE ARMY 
DOES NOT PRODUCE THE SLIGHTEST STIRA BLIND MAN HAS LEFT IT 
THERE ARE THOUSANDS SUCH AS I IN RUSSIA
THE FIELD MARSHAL IS ANGRY WITH THE EMPEROR AND HE 
PUNISHES US ALL ISNT IT LOGICAL
THIS IS THE FIRST ACT THOSE THAT FOLLOW ARE NATURALLY IN 
CREASINGLY INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING AFTER THE FIELD 
MARSHALS DEPARTURE IT APPEARS THAT WE ARE WITHIN SIGHT OF 
THE ENEMY AND MUST GIVE BATTLE BUXHOWDEN IS COMMANDER 
IN CHIEF BY SENIORITY BUT GENERAL BENNIGSEN DOES NOT QUITE 
SEE IT MORE PARTICULARLY AS IT IS HE AND HIS CORPS WHO ARE 
WITHIN SIGHT OF THE ENEMY AND HE WISHES TO PROFIT BY THE OP 
PORTUNITY TO FIGHT A BATTLE ON HIS OWN HAND AS THE GERMANS 
SAY HE DOES SO THIS IS THE BATTLE OF PULTUSK WHICH IS CON 
SIDERED A GREAT VICTORY BUT IN MY OPINION WAS NOTHING OF 
THE KIND WE CIVILIANS AS YOU KNOW HAVE A VERY BAD WAY 
OF DECIDING WHETHER A BATTLE WAS WON OR LOST THOSE WHO 
RETREAT AFTER A BATTLE HAVE LOST IT IS WHAT WE SAY AND ACCORD 
ING TO THAT IT IS WE WHO LOST THE BATTLE OF PULTUSK IN SHORT 
WE RETREAT AFTER THE BATTLE BUT SEND A COURIER TO PETERSBURG 
WITH NEWS OF A VICTORY AND GENERAL BENNIGSEN HOPING TO 
RECEIVE FROM PETERSBURG THE POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF AS 
A REWARD FOR HIS VICTORY DOES NOT GIVE UP THE COMMAND OF 
THE ARMY TO GENERAL BUXHOWDEN DURING THIS INTERREGNUM 
WE BEGIN A VERY ORIGINAL AND INTERESTING SERIES OF MANEU 
VERS OUR AIM IS NO LONGER AS IT SHOULD BE TO AVOID OR ATTACK  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMTHE ENEMY BUT SOLELY TO AVOID GENERAL BUXHOWDEN WHO BY 
RIGHT OF SENIORITY SHOULD BE OUR CHIEF SO ENERGETICALLY DO WE 
PURSUE THIS AIM THAT AFTER CROSSING AN UNFORDABLE RIVER WE 
BURN THE BRIDGES TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM OUR ENEMY WHO 
AT THE MOMENT IS NOT BONAPARTE BUT BUXHOWDEN GENERAL 
BUXHOWDEN WAS ALL BUT ATTACKED AND CAPTURED BY A SUPERIOR 
ENEMY FORCE AS A RESULT OF ONE OF THESE MANEUVERS THAT EN 
ABLED US TO ESCAPE HIM BUXHOWDEN PURSUES USWE SCUTTLE 
HE HARDLY CROSSES THE RIVER TO OUR SIDE BEFORE WE RECROSS TO 
THE OTHER AT LAST OUR ENEMY BUXHOWDEN CATCHES US AND AT 
TACKS BOTH GENERALS ARE ANGRY AND THE RESULT IS A CHALLENGE 
ON BUXHOWDENS PART AND AN EPILEPTIC FIT ON BENNIGSENS 
BUT AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT THE COURIER WHO CARRIED THE NEWS 
OF OUR VICTORY AT PULTUSK TO PETERSBURG RETURNS BRINGING OUR 
APPOINTMENT AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND OUR FIRST FOE BUX 
HOWDEN IS VANQUISHED WE CAN NOW TURN OUR THOUGHTS TO THE 
SECOND BONAPARTE BUT AS IT TURNS OUT JUST AT THAT MOMENT 
A THIRD ENEMY RISES BEFORE USNAMELY THE ORTHODOX RUSSIAN 
SOLDIERS LOUDLY DEMANDING BREAD MEAT BISCUITS FODDER 
AND WHATNOT THE STORES ARE EMPTY THE ROADS IMPASSABLE 
THE ORTHODOX BEGIN LOOTING AND IN A WAY OF WHICH OUR LAST 
CAMPAIGN CAN GIVE YOU NO IDEA HALF THE REGIMENTS FORM 
BANDS AND SCOUR THE COUNTRYSIDE AND PUT EVERYTHING TO FIRE 
AND SWORD THE INHABITANTS ARE TOTALLY RUINED THE HOSPITALS 
OVERFLOW WITH SICK AND FAMINE IS EVERYWHERE TWICE THE MA 
RAUDERS EVEN ATTACK OUR HEADQUARTERS AND THE COMMANDER 
IN CHIEF HAS TO ASK FOR A BATTALION TO DISPERSE THEM DURING 
ONE OF THESE ATTACKS THEY CARRIED OFF MY EMPTY PORTMAN 
TEAU AND MY DRESSING GOWN THE EMPEROR PROPOSES TO GIVE WAR AND PEACE ALL COMMANDERS OF DIVISIONS THE RIGHT TO SHOOT MARAUDERS 
BUT I MUCH FEAR THIS WILL OBLIGE ONE HALF THE ARMY TO SHOOT 
THE OTHER
AT FIRST PRINCE ANDREW READ WITH HIS EYES ONLY BUT AFTER 
A WHILE IN SPITE OF HIMSELF ALTHOUGH HE KNEW HOW FAR IT WAS 
SAFE TO TRUST BILIBIN WHAT HE HAD READ BEGAN TO INTEREST HIM 
MORE AND MORE WHEN HE HAD READ THUS FAR HE CRUMPLED 
THE LETTER UP AND THREW IT AWAY IT WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD READ

HIM THAT THE CHILD WAS DEAD ALL THAT HE SAW AND HEARD 
SEEMED TO CONFIRM THIS TERROR
ALL IS OVER HE THOUGHT AND A COLD SWEAT BROKE OUT ON

WOULD FIND IT EMPTY AND THAT THE NURSE HAD BEEN HIDING THE 
DEAD BABY HE DREW THE CURTAIN ASIDE AND FOR SOME TIME HIS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMFRIGHTENED RESTLESS EYES COULD NOT FIND THE BABY AT LAST HE 
SAW HIM THE ROSY BOY HAD TOSSED ABOUT TILL HE LAY ACROSS THE 
BED WITH HIS HEAD LOWER THAN THE PILLOW AND WAS SMACKING 
HIS LIPS IN HIS SLEEP AND BREATHING EVENLY
PRINCE ANDREW WAS AS GLAD TO FIND THE BOY LIKE THAT AS IF 
HE HAD ALREADY LOST HIM HE BENT OVER HIM AND AS HIS SISTER 
HAD TAUGHT HIM TRIED WITH HIS LIPS WHETHER THE CHILD WAS

STEPS LIFTED THE CURTAIN AND DROPPED IT AGAIN BEHIND HER 
PRINCE ANDREW RECOGNIZED HER WITHOUT LOOKING AND HELD 
OUT HIS HAND TO HER SHE PRESSED IT

I WAS COMING TO TELL YOU SO
THE CHILD MOVED SLIGHTLY IN HIS SLEEP SMILED AND RUBBED 
HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST THE PILLOW

USUAL FROM THE TEARS OF JOY THAT WERE IN THEM SHE LEANED WAR AND PEACE OVER TO HER BROTHER AND KISSED HIM SLIGHTLY CATCHING THE

YEAR HE WAS OBLIGED TO BORROW BESIDES THIS THE CHIEF STEWARD 
WROTE EVERY YEAR TELLING HIM OF FIRES AND BAD HARVESTS OR OF 
THE NECESSITY OF REBUILDING FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS SO THE 
FIRST TASK PIERRE HAD TO FACE WAS ONE FOR WHICH HE HAD VERY 
LITTLE APTITUDE OR INCLINATIONPRACTICAL BUSINESS
HE DISCUSSED ESTATE AFFAIRS EVERY DAY WITH HIS CHIEF STEW 
ARD BUT HE FELT THAT THIS DID NOT FORWARD MATTERS AT ALL HE 
FELT THAT THESE CONSULTATIONS WERE DETACHED FROM REAL AFFAIRS 
AND DID NOT LINK UP WITH THEM OR MAKE THEM MOVE ON THE 
ONE HAND THE CHIEF STEWARD PUT THE STATE OF THINGS TO HIM 
IN THE VERY WORST LIGHT POINTING OUT THE NECESSITY OF PAYING  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMOFF THE DEBTS AND UNDERTAKING NEW ACTIVITIES WITH SERF LABOR 
TO WHICH PIERRE DID NOT AGREE ON THE OTHER HAND PIERRE 
DEMANDED THAT STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO LIBERATE THE SERFS 
WHICH THE STEWARD MET BY SHOWING THE NECESSITY OF FIRST PAY 
ING OFF THE LOANS FROM THE LAND BANK AND THE CONSEQUENT 
IMPOSSIBILITY OF A SPEEDY EMANCIPATION
THE STEWARD DID NOT SAY IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE BUT SUG 
GESTED SELLING THE FORESTS IN THE PROVINCE OF KOSTROMA THE 
LAND LOWER DOWN THE RIVER AND THE CRIMEAN ESTATE IN OR 
DER TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE ALL OF WHICH OPERATIONS ACCORDING 
TO HIM WERE CONNECTED WITH SUCH COMPLICATED MEASURESTHE 
REMOVAL OF INJUNCTIONS PETITIONS PERMITS AND SO ONTHAT 
PIERRE BECAME QUITE BEWILDERED AND ONLY REPLIED
YES YES DO SO
PIERRE HAD NONE OF THE PRACTICAL PERSISTENCE THAT WOULD 
HAVE ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND TO THE BUSINESS HIMSELF AND SO 
HE DISLIKED IT AND ONLY TRIED TO PRETEND TO THE STEWARD THAT 
HE WAS ATTENDING TO IT THE STEWARD FOR HIS PART TRIED TO PRE 
TEND TO THE COUNT THAT HE CONSIDERED THESE CONSULTATIONS VERY 
VALUABLE FOR THE PROPRIETOR AND TROUBLESOME TO HIMSELF
IN KIEV PIERRE FOUND SOME PEOPLE HE KNEW AND STRANGERS 
HASTENED TO MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND JOYFULLY WELCOMED 
THE RICH NEWCOMER THE LARGEST LANDOWNER OF THE PROVINCE 
TEMPTATIONS TO PIERRES GREATEST WEAKNESSTHE ONE TO WHICH 
HE HAD CONFESSED WHEN ADMITTED TO THE LODGEWERE SO STRONG 
THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST THEM AGAIN WHOLE DAYS WEEKS AND 
MONTHS OF HIS LIFE PASSED IN AS GREAT A RUSH AND WERE AS MUCH 
OCCUPIED WITH EVENING PARTIES DINNERS LUNCHES AND BALLS 
GIVING HIM NO TIME FOR REFLECTION AS IN PETERSBURG INSTEAD WAR AND PEACE OF THE NEW LIFE HE HAD HOPED TO LEAD HE STILL LIVED THE OLD LIFE 
ONLY IN NEW SURROUNDINGS
OF THE THREE PRECEPTS OF FREEMASONRY PIERRE REALIZED 
THAT HE DID NOT FULFILL THE ONE WHICH ENJOINED EVERY MASON 
TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF MORAL LIFE AND THAT OF THE SEVEN VIRTUES 
HE LACKED TWOMORALITY AND THE LOVE OF DEATH HE CONSOLED 
HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE FULFILLED ANOTHER OF THE 
PRECEPTSTHAT OF REFORMING THE HUMAN RACEAND HAD OTHER 
VIRTUESLOVE OF HIS NEIGHBOR AND ESPECIALLY GENEROSITY
IN THE SPRING OF  HE DECIDED TO RETURN TO PETERSBURG 
ON THE WAY HE INTENDED TO VISIT ALL HIS ESTATES AND SEE FOR 
HIMSELF HOW FAR HIS ORDERS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AND IN WHAT 
STATE WERE THE SERFS WHOM GOD HAD ENTRUSTED TO HIS CARE AND 
WHOM HE INTENDED TO BENEFIT
THE CHIEF STEWARD WHO CONSIDERED THE YOUNG COUNTS AT 
TEMPTS ALMOST INSANEUNPROFITABLE TO HIMSELF TO THE COUNT 
AND TO THE SERFSMADE SOME CONCESSIONS CONTINUING TO 
REPRESENT THE LIBERATION OF THE SERFS AS IMPRACTICABLE HE AR 
RANGED FOR THE ERECTION OF LARGE BUILDINGSSCHOOLS HOSPITALS 
AND ASYLUMSON ALL THE ESTATES BEFORE THE MASTER ARRIVED 
EVERYWHERE PREPARATIONS WERE MADE NOT FOR CEREMONIOUS 
WELCOMES WHICH HE KNEW PIERRE WOULD NOT LIKE BUT FOR JUST 
SUCH GRATEFULLY RELIGIOUS ONES WITH OFFERINGS OF ICONS AND 
THE BREAD AND SALT OF HOSPITALITY AS ACCORDING TO HIS UNDER 
STANDING OF HIS MASTER WOULD TOUCH AND DELUDE HIM
THE SOUTHERN SPRING THE COMFORTABLE RAPID TRAVELING IN 
A VIENNA CARRIAGE AND THE SOLITUDE OF THE ROAD ALL HAD A 
GLADDENING EFFECT ON PIERRE THE ESTATES HE HAD NOT BEFORE 
VISITED WERE EACH MORE PICTURESQUE THAN THE OTHER THE SERFS  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMEVERYWHERE SEEMED THRIVING AND TOUCHINGLY GRATEFUL FOR THE 
BENEFITS CONFERRED ON THEM EVERYWHERE WERE RECEPTIONS 
WHICH THOUGH THEY EMBARRASSED PIERRE AWAKENED A JOYFUL 
FEELING IN THE DEPTH OF HIS HEART IN ONE PLACE THE PEASANTS 
PRESENTED HIM WITH BREAD AND SALT AND AN ICON OF SAINT PETER 
AND SAINT PAUL ASKING PERMISSION AS A MARK OF THEIR GRATI 
TUDE FOR THE BENEFITS HE HAD CONFERRED ON THEM TO BUILD A 
NEW CHANTRY TO THE CHURCH AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE IN HONOR OF 
PETER AND PAUL HIS PATRON SAINTS IN ANOTHER PLACE THE WOM 
EN WITH INFANTS IN ARMS MET HIM TO THANK HIM FOR RELEASING 
THEM FROM HARD WORK ON A THIRD ESTATE THE PRIEST BEARING 
A CROSS CAME TO MEET HIM SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN WHOM 
BY THE COUNTS GENEROSITY HE WAS INSTRUCTING IN READING 
WRITING AND RELIGION ON ALL HIS ESTATES PIERRE SAW WITH HIS 
OWN EYES BRICK BUILDINGS ERECTED OR IN COURSE OF ERECTION ALL 
ON ONE PLAN FOR HOSPITALS SCHOOLS AND ALMSHOUSES WHICH 
WERE SOON TO BE OPENED EVERYWHERE HE SAW THE STEWARDS 
ACCOUNTS ACCORDING TO WHICH THE SERFS MANORIAL LABOR HAD 
BEEN DIMINISHED AND HEARD THE TOUCHING THANKS OF DEPUTA 
TIONS OF SERFS IN THEIR FULLSKIRTED BLUE COATS
WHAT PIERRE DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT THE PLACE WHERE THEY 
PRESENTED HIM WITH BREAD AND SALT AND WISHED TO BUILD A 
CHANTRY IN HONOR OF PETER AND PAUL WAS A MARKET VILLAGE 
WHERE A FAIR WAS HELD ON ST PETERS DAY AND THAT THE RICH 
EST PEASANTS WHO FORMED THE DEPUTATION HAD BEGUN THE 
CHANTRY LONG BEFORE BUT THAT NINE TENTHS OF THE PEASANTS IN 
THAT VILLAGES WERE IN A STATE OF THE GREATEST POVERTY HE DID 
NOT KNOW THAT SINCE THE NURSING MOTHERS WERE NO LONGER SENT 
TO WORK ON HIS LAND THEY DID STILL HARDER WORK ON THEIR OWN WAR AND PEACE LAND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE PRIEST WHO MET HIM WITH THE 
CROSS OPPRESSED THE PEASANTS BY HIS EXACTIONS AND THAT THE 
PUPILS PARENTS WEPT AT HAVING TO LET HIM TAKE THEIR CHILDREN 
AND SECURED THEIR RELEASE BY HEAVY PAYMENTS HE DID NOT 
KNOW THAT THE BRICK BUILDINGS BUILT TO PLAN WERE BEING BUILT 
BY SERFS WHOSE MANORIAL LABOR WAS THUS INCREASED THOUGH 
LESSENED ON PAPER HE DID NOT KNOW THAT WHERE THE STEWARD 
HAD SHOWN HIM IN THE ACCOUNTS THAT THE SERFS PAYMENTS HAD 
BEEN DIMINISHED BY A THIRD THEIR OBLIGATORY MANORIAL WORK 
HAD BEEN INCREASED BY A HALF AND SO PIERRE WAS DELIGHTED 
WITH HIS VISIT TO HIS ESTATES AND QUITE RECOVERED THE PHILAN 
THROPIC MOOD IN WHICH HE HAD LEFT PETERSBURG AND WROTE 
ENTHUSIASTIC LETTERS TO HIS BROTHERINSTRUCTOR AS HE CALLED 
THE GRAND MASTER
HOW EASY IT IS HOW LITTLE EFFORT IT NEEDS TO DO SO MUCH 
GOOD THOUGHT PIERRE AND HOW LITTLE ATTENTION WE PAY TO 
IT
HE WAS PLEASED AT THE GRATITUDE HE RECEIVED BUT FELT 
ABASHED AT RECEIVING IT THIS GRATITUDE REMINDED HIM OF HOW 
MUCH MORE HE MIGHT DO FOR THESE SIMPLE KINDLY PEOPLE
THE CHIEF STEWARD A VERY STUPID BUT CUNNING MAN WHO 
SAW PERFECTLY THROUGH THE NAIVE AND INTELLIGENT COUNT AND 
PLAYED WITH HIM AS WITH A TOY SEEING THE EFFECT THESE PREAR 
RANGED RECEPTIONS HAD ON PIERRE PRESSED HIM STILL HARDER 
WITH PROOFS OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY AND ABOVE ALL THE USELESS 
NESS OF FREEING THE SERFS WHO WERE QUITE HAPPY AS IT WAS
PIERRE IN HIS SECRET SOUL AGREED WITH THE STEWARD THAT IT 
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HAPPIER PEOPLE AND THAT GOD 
ONLY KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM WHEN THEY WERE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMFREE BUT HE INSISTED THOUGH RELUCTANTLY ON WHAT HE THOUGHT 
RIGHT THE STEWARD PROMISED TO DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO CARRY 
OUT THE COUNTS WISHES SEEING CLEARLY THAT NOT ONLY WOULD 
THE COUNT NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHETHER ALL MEASURES HAD 
BEEN TAKEN FOR THE SALE OF THE LAND AND FORESTS AND TO RELEASE 
THEM FROM THE LAND BANK BUT WOULD PROBABLY NEVER EVEN 
INQUIRE AND WOULD NEVER KNOW THAT THE NEWLY ERECTED BUILD 
INGS WERE STANDING EMPTY AND THAT THE SERFS CONTINUED TO 
GIVE IN MONEY AND WORK ALL THAT OTHER PEOPLES SERFS GAVETHAT 
IS TO SAY ALL THAT COULD BE GOT OUT OF THEMWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER XI
RETURNING FROM HIS JOURNEY THROUGH SOUTH RUSSIA IN THE 
HAPPIEST STATE OF MIND PIERRE CARRIED OUT AN INTENTION HE 
HAD LONG HAD OF VISITING HIS FRIEND BOLKONSKI WHOM HE HAD 
NOT SEEN FOR TWO YEARS
BOGUCHAROVO LAY IN A FLAT UNINTERESTING PART OF THE COUN 
TRY AMONG FIELDS AND FORESTS OF FIR AND BIRCH WHICH WERE 
PARTLY CUT DOWN THE HOUSE LAY BEHIND A NEWLY DUG POND 
FILLED WITH WATER TO THE BRINK AND WITH BANKS STILL BARE OF 
GRASS IT WAS AT THE END OF A VILLAGE THAT STRETCHED ALONG THE 
HIGHROAD IN THE MIDST OF A YOUNG COPSE IN WHICH WERE A FEW 
FIR TREES
THE HOMESTEAD CONSISTED OF A THRESHING FLOOR OUTHOUS 
ES STABLES A BATHHOUSE A LODGE AND A LARGE BRICK HOUSE 
WITH SEMICIRCULAR FACADE STILL IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION 
ROUND THE HOUSE WAS A GARDEN NEWLY LAID OUT THE FENCES

PRINCE LIVED POINTED OUT A SMALL NEWLY BUILT LODGE CLOSE TO 
THE POND ANTON A MAN WHO HAD LOOKED AFTER PRINCE AN 
DREW IN HIS BOYHOOD HELPED PIERRE OUT OF HIS CARRIAGE SAID 
THAT THE PRINCE WAS AT HOME AND SHOWED HIM INTO A CLEAN  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMLITTLE ANTEROOM
PIERRE WAS STRUCK BY THE MODESTY OF THE SMALL THOUGH 
CLEAN HOUSE AFTER THE BRILLIANT SURROUNDINGS IN WHICH HE HAD 
LAST MET HIS FRIEND IN PETERSBURG
HE QUICKLY ENTERED THE SMALL RECEPTION ROOM WITH ITS 
STILLUNPLASTERED WOODEN WALLS REDOLENT OF PINE AND WOULD 
HAVE GONE FARTHER BUT ANTON RAN AHEAD ON TIPTOE AND 
KNOCKED AT A DOOR
WELL WHAT IS IT CAME A SHARP UNPLEASANT VOICE
A VISITOR ANSWERED ANTON
ASK HIM TO WAIT AND THE SOUND WAS HEARD OF A CHAIR BE 
ING PUSHED BACK
PIERRE WENT WITH RAPID STEPS TO THE DOOR AND SUDDEN 
LY CAME FACE TO FACE WITH PRINCE ANDREW WHO CAME OUT 
FROWNING AND LOOKING OLD PIERRE EMBRACED HIM AND LIFTING 
HIS SPECTACLES KISSED HIS FRIEND ON THE CHEEK AND LOOKED AT 
HIM CLOSELY
WELL I DID NOT EXPECT YOU I AM VERY GLAD SAID PRINCE 
ANDREW
PIERRE SAID NOTHING HE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS FRIEND WITH 
SURPRISE HE WAS STRUCK BY THE CHANGE IN HIM HIS WORDS 
WERE KINDLY AND THERE WAS A SMILE ON HIS LIPS AND FACE BUT 
HIS EYES WERE DULL AND LIFELESS AND IN SPITE OF HIS EVIDENT WISH 
TO DO SO HE COULD NOT GIVE THEM A JOYOUS AND GLAD SPARKLE 
PRINCE ANDREW HAD GROWN THINNER PALER AND MORE MANLY
LOOKING BUT WHAT AMAZED AND ESTRANGED PIERRE TILL HE GOT 
USED TO IT WERE HIS INERTIA AND A WRINKLE ON HIS BROW INDICAT 
ING PROLONGED CONCENTRATION ON SOME ONE THOUGHT
AS IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH PEOPLE MEETING AFTER A PRO WAR AND PEACE LONGED SEPARATION IT WAS LONG BEFORE THEIR CONVERSATION 
COULD SETTLE ON ANYTHING THEY PUT QUESTIONS AND GAVE BRIEF 
REPLIES ABOUT THINGS THEY KNEW OUGHT TO BE TALKED OVER AT 
LENGTH AT LAST THE CONVERSATION GRADUALLY SETTLED ON SOME OF 
THE TOPICS AT FIRST LIGHTLY TOUCHED ON THEIR PAST LIFE PLANS FOR 
THE FUTURE PIERRES JOURNEYS AND OCCUPATIONS THE WAR AND 
SO ON THE PREOCCUPATION AND DESPONDENCY WHICH PIERRE 
HAD NOTICED IN HIS FRIENDS LOOK WAS NOW STILL MORE CLEARLY 
EXPRESSED IN THE SMILE WITH WHICH HE LISTENED TO PIERRE ES 
PECIALLY WHEN HE SPOKE WITH JOYFUL ANIMATION OF THE PAST OR 
THE FUTURE IT WAS AS IF PRINCE ANDREW WOULD HAVE LIKED TO 
SYMPATHIZE WITH WHAT PIERRE WAS SAYING BUT COULD NOT THE 
LATTER BEGAN TO FEEL THAT IT WAS IN BAD TASTE TO SPEAK OF HIS EN 
THUSIASMS DREAMS AND HOPES OF HAPPINESS OR GOODNESS IN 
PRINCE ANDREWS PRESENCE HE WAS ASHAMED TO EXPRESS HIS 
NEW MASONIC VIEWS WHICH HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY REVIVED 
AND STRENGTHENED BY HIS LATE TOUR HE CHECKED HIMSELF FEAR 
ING TO SEEM NAIVE YET HE FELT AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO SHOW 
HIS FRIEND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS NOW A QUITE DIFFER 
ENT AND BETTER PIERRE THAN HE HAD BEEN IN PETERSBURG
I CANT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HAVE LIVED THROUGH SINCE

TRYING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO CONCEAL HIS OWN PART IN THE IM 
PROVEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE PRINCE ANDREW SEVERAL 
TIMES PROMPTED PIERRES STORY OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING 
AS THOUGH IT WERE ALL AN OLDTIME STORY AND HE LISTENED NOT 
ONLY WITHOUT INTEREST BUT EVEN AS IF ASHAMED OF WHAT PIERRE 
WAS TELLING HIM
PIERRE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AND EVEN DEPRESSED IN HIS 
FRIENDS COMPANY AND AT LAST BECAME SILENT
ILL TELL YOU WHAT MY DEAR FELLOW SAID PRINCE ANDREW 
WHO EVIDENTLY ALSO FELT DEPRESSED AND CONSTRAINED WITH HIS 
VISITOR I AM ONLY BIVOUACKING HERE AND HAVE JUST COME TO

PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW EACH OTHER INTIMATELY PRINCE AN 
DREW SPOKE WITH SOME ANIMATION AND INTEREST ONLY OF THE 
NEW HOMESTEAD HE WAS CONSTRUCTING AND ITS BUILDINGS BUT 
EVEN HERE WHILE ON THE SCAFFOLDING IN THE MIDST OF A TALK 
EXPLAINING THE FUTURE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE HOUSE HE INTER WAR AND PEACE RUPTED HIMSELF

WISHING TO EXPRESS HIS NEW OUTLOOK TO PIERRE HE SPOKE IN 
FRENCH I ONLY KNOW TWO VERY REAL EVILS IN LIFE REMORSE AND 
ILLNESS THE ONLY GOOD IS THE ABSENCE OF THOSE EVILS TO LIVE 
FOR MYSELF AVOIDING THOSE TWO EVILS IS MY WHOLE PHILOSOPHY

PIERRE NO I CANT AGREE WITH YOU TO LIVE ONLY SO AS NOT

SMILE
WHEN YOU SEE MY SISTER PRINCESS MARY YOULL GET ON

ADDED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE BUT EVERYONE LIVES IN HIS OWN 
WAY YOU LIVED FOR YOURSELF AND SAY YOU NEARLY RUINED YOUR 
LIFE AND ONLY FOUND HAPPINESS WHEN YOU BEGAN LIVING FOR

SOURCE OF ALL ERROR AND EVIL LE PROCHAINYOUR KIEV PEASANTS 
TO WHOM YOU WANT TO DO GOOD
AND HE LOOKED AT PIERRE WITH A MOCKING CHALLENGING EX 
PRESSION HE EVIDENTLY WISHED TO DRAW HIM ON
YOU ARE JOKING REPLIED PIERRE GROWING MORE AND MORE 
EXCITED WHAT ERROR OR EVIL CAN THERE BE IN MY WISHING TO 
DO GOOD AND EVEN DOING A LITTLETHOUGH I DID VERY LITTLE AND

EMONIES AND MEANINGLESS PRAYERS AND ARE NOW INSTRUCTED 
IN A COMFORTING BELIEF IN FUTURE LIFE RETRIBUTION RECOM 
PENSE AND CONSOLATION WHAT EVIL AND ERROR ARE THERE IN 
IT IF PEOPLE WERE DYING OF DISEASE WITHOUT HELP WHILE MATE 
RIAL ASSISTANCE COULD SO EASILY BE RENDERED AND I SUPPLIED 
THEM WITH A DOCTOR A HOSPITAL AND AN ASYLUM FOR THE AGED 
AND IS IT NOT A PALPABLE UNQUESTIONABLE GOOD IF A PEASANT 
OR A WOMAN WITH A BABY HAS NO REST DAY OR NIGHT AND I GIVE 
THEM REST AND LEISURE SAID PIERRE HURRYING AND LISPING 
AND I HAVE DONE THAT THOUGH BADLY AND TO A SMALL EXTENT 
BUT I HAVE DONE SOMETHING TOWARD IT AND YOU CANNOT PER 
SUADE ME THAT IT WAS NOT A GOOD ACTION AND MORE THAN THAT 
YOU CANT MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT YOU DO NOT THINK SO YOUR  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMSELF AND THE MAIN THING IS HE CONTINUED THAT I KNOW AND 
KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE ENJOYMENT OF DOING THIS GOOD IS 
THE ONLY SURE HAPPINESS IN LIFE
YES IF YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT ITS QUITE A DIFFERENT MATTER 
SAID PRINCE ANDREW I BUILD A HOUSE AND LAY OUT A GARDEN

A PASTIME BUT WHATS RIGHT AND WHATS GOOD MUST BE JUDGED 
BY ONE WHO KNOWS ALL BUT NOT BY US WELL YOU WANT AN AR 
GUMENT HE ADDED COME ON THEN
THEY ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND SAT DOWN IN THE ENTRANCE 
PORCH WHICH SERVED AS A VERANDA
COME LETS ARGUE THEN SAID PRINCE ANDREW YOU TALK 
OF SCHOOLS HE WENT ON CROOKING A FINGER EDUCATION AND SO 
FORTH THAT IS YOU WANT TO RAISE HIM POINTING TO A PEASANT 
WHO PASSED BY THEM TAKING OFF HIS CAP FROM HIS ANIMAL 
CONDITION AND AWAKEN IN HIM SPIRITUAL NEEDS WHILE IT SEEMS 
TO ME THAT ANIMAL HAPPINESS IS THE ONLY HAPPINESS POSSI 
BLE AND THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU WANT TO DEPRIVE HIM OF I ENVY 
HIM BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE HIM WHAT I AM WITHOUT GIVING 
HIM MY MEANS THEN YOU SAY LIGHTEN HIS TOIL BUT AS I SEE 
IT PHYSICAL LABOR IS AS ESSENTIAL TO HIM AS MUCH A CONDI 
TION OF HIS EXISTENCE AS MENTAL ACTIVITY IS TO YOU OR ME YOU 
CANT HELP THINKING I GO TO BED AFTER TWO IN THE MORNING 
THOUGHTS COME AND I CANT SLEEP BUT TOSS ABOUT TILL DAWN BE 
CAUSE I THINK AND CANT HELP THINKING JUST AS HE CANT HELP 
PLOWING AND MOWING IF HE DIDNT HE WOULD GO TO THE DRINK 
SHOP OR FALL ILL JUST AS I COULD NOT STAND HIS TERRIBLE PHYSICAL 
LABOR BUT SHOULD DIE OF IT IN A WEEK SO HE COULD NOT STAND 
MY PHYSICAL IDLENESS BUT WOULD GROW FAT AND DIE THE THIRD WAR AND PEACE THINGWHAT ELSE WAS IT YOU TALKED ABOUT AND PRINCE ANDREW 
CROOKED A THIRD FINGER AH YES HOSPITALS MEDICINE HE HAS 
A FIT HE IS DYING AND YOU COME AND BLEED HIM AND PATCH HIM 
UP HE WILL DRAG ABOUT AS A CRIPPLE A BURDEN TO EVERYBODY 
FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS IT WOULD BE FAR EASIER AND SIMPLER FOR 
HIM TO DIE OTHERS ARE BEING BORN AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
THEM AS IT IS IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF YOU GRUDGED LOSING A LA 
BORERTHATS HOW I REGARD HIMBUT YOU WANT TO CURE HIM FROM 
LOVE OF HIM AND HE DOES NOT WANT THAT AND BESIDES WHAT A 
NOTION THAT MEDICINE EVER CURED ANYONE KILLED THEM YES 
SAID HE FROWNING ANGRILY AND TURNING AWAY FROM PIERRE
PRINCE ANDREW EXPRESSED HIS IDEAS SO CLEARLY AND DIS 
TINCTLY THAT IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD REFLECTED ON THIS SUBJECT 
MORE THAN ONCE AND HE SPOKE READILY AND RAPIDLY LIKE A 
MAN WHO HAS NOT TALKED FOR A LONG TIME HIS GLANCE BECAME 
MORE ANIMATED AS HIS CONCLUSIONS BECAME MORE HOPELESS
OH THAT IS DREADFUL DREADFUL SAID PIERRE I DONT UNDER 
STAND HOW ONE CAN LIVE WITH SUCH IDEAS I HAD SUCH MOMENTS 
MYSELF NOT LONG AGO IN MOSCOW AND WHEN TRAVELING BUT AT 
SUCH TIMES I COLLAPSED SO THAT I DONT LIVE AT ALLEVERYTHING 
SEEMS HATEFUL TO ME MYSELF MOST OF ALL THEN I DONT EAT 
DONT WASH AND HOW IS IT WITH YOU
WHY NOT WASH THAT IS NOT CLEANLY SAID PRINCE ANDREW 
ON THE CONTRARY ONE MUST TRY TO MAKE ONES LIFE AS PLEASANT 
AS POSSIBLE IM ALIVE THAT IS NOT MY FAULT SO I MUST LIVE OUT 
MY LIFE AS BEST I CAN WITHOUT HURTING OTHERS
BUT WITH SUCH IDEAS WHAT MOTIVE HAVE YOU FOR LIVING 
ONE WOULD SIT WITHOUT MOVING UNDERTAKING NOTHING
LIFE AS IT IS LEAVES ONE NO PEACE I SHOULD BE THANKFUL TO  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMDO NOTHING BUT HERE ON THE ONE HAND THE LOCAL NOBILITY HAVE 
DONE ME THE HONOR TO CHOOSE ME TO BE THEIR MARSHAL IT WAS 
ALL I COULD DO TO GET OUT OF IT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND 
THAT I HAVE NOT THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS FOR ITTHE KIND OF 
GOODNATURED FUSSY SHALLOWNESS NECESSARY FOR THE POSITION 
THEN THERES THIS HOUSE WHICH MUST BE BUILT IN ORDER TO HAVE 
A NOOK OF ONES OWN IN WHICH TO BE QUIET AND NOW THERES 
THIS RECRUITING
WHY ARENT YOU SERVING IN THE ARMY
AFTER AUSTERLITZ SAID PRINCE ANDREW GLOOMILY NO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE PROMISED MYSELF NOT TO SERVE 
AGAIN IN THE ACTIVE RUSSIAN ARMY AND I WONTNOT EVEN IF 
BONAPARTE WERE HERE AT SMOLENSK THREATENING BALD HILL 
SEVEN THEN I WOULDNT SERVE IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY WELL AS I 
WAS SAYING HE CONTINUED RECOVERING HIS COMPOSURE NOW 
THERES THIS RECRUITING MY FATHER IS CHIEF IN COMMAND OF THE 
THIRD DISTRICT AND MY ONLY WAY OF AVOIDING ACTIVE SERVICE IS 
TO SERVE UNDER HIM
THEN YOU ARE SERVING
I AM
HE PAUSED A LITTLE WHILE
AND WHY DO YOU SERVE
WHY FOR THIS REASON MY FATHER IS ONE OF THE MOST RE 
MARKABLE MEN OF HIS TIME BUT HE IS GROWING OLD AND THOUGH 
NOT EXACTLY CRUEL HE HAS TOO ENERGETIC A CHARACTER HE IS SO 
ACCUSTOMED TO UNLIMITED POWER THAT HE IS TERRIBLE AND NOW 
HE HAS THIS AUTHORITY OF A COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RECRUIT 
ING GRANTED BY THE EMPEROR IF I HAD BEEN TWO HOURS LATE 
A FORTNIGHT AGO HE WOULD HAVE HAD A PAYMASTERS CLERK AT WAR AND PEACE YUKHNOVNA HANGED SAID PRINCE ANDREW WITH A SMILE SO 
I AM SERVING BECAUSE I ALONE HAVE ANY INFLUENCE WITH MY 
FATHER AND NOW AND THEN CAN SAVE HIM FROM ACTIONS WHICH 
WOULD TORMENT HIM AFTERWARDS
WELL THERE YOU SEE
YES BUT IT IS NOT AS YOU IMAGINE PRINCE ANDREW CON 
TINUED I DID NOT AND DO NOT IN THE LEAST CARE ABOUT THAT 
SCOUNDREL OF A CLERK WHO HAD STOLEN SOME BOOTS FROM THE RE 
CRUITS I SHOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM HANGED 
BUT I WAS SORRY FOR MY FATHERTHAT AGAIN IS FOR MYSELF
PRINCE ANDREW GREW MORE AND MORE ANIMATED HIS EYES 
GLITTERED FEVERISHLY WHILE HE TRIED TO PROVE TO PIERRE THAT IN 
HIS ACTIONS THERE WAS NO DESIRE TO DO GOOD TO HIS NEIGHBOR
THERE NOW YOU WISH TO LIBERATE YOUR SERFS HE CONTINUED 
THAT IS A VERY GOOD THING BUT NOT FOR YOUI DONT SUPPOSE 
YOU EVER HAD ANYONE FLOGGED OR SENT TO SIBERIAAND STILL LESS 
FOR YOUR SERFS IF THEY ARE BEATEN FLOGGED OR SENT TO SIBERIA 
I DONT SUPPOSE THEY ARE ANY THE WORSE OFF IN SIBERIA THEY 
LEAD THE SAME ANIMAL LIFE AND THE STRIPES ON THEIR BODIES 
HEAL AND THEY ARE HAPPY AS BEFORE BUT IT IS A GOOD THING FOR 
PROPRIETORS WHO PERISH MORALLY BRING REMORSE UPON THEM 
SELVES STIFLE THIS REMORSE AND GROW CALLOUS AS A RESULT OF 
BEING ABLE TO INFLICT PUNISHMENTS JUSTLY AND UNJUSTLY IT IS 
THOSE PEOPLE I PITY AND FOR THEIR SAKE I SHOULD LIKE TO LIBER 
ATE THE SERFS YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN BUT I HAVE SEEN HOW 
GOOD MEN BROUGHT UP IN THOSE TRADITIONS OF UNLIMITED POW 
ER IN TIME WHEN THEY GROW MORE IRRITABLE BECOME CRUEL AND 
HARSH ARE CONSCIOUS OF IT BUT CANNOT RESTRAIN THEMSELVES 
AND GROW MORE AND MORE MISERABLE FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMPRINCE ANDREW SPOKE SO EARNESTLY THAT PIERRE COULD NOT 
HELP THINKING THAT THESE THOUGHTS HAD BEEN SUGGESTED TO 
PRINCE ANDREW BY HIS FATHERS CASE
HE DID NOT REPLY
SO THATS WHAT IM SORRY FORHUMAN DIGNITY PEACE OF 
MIND PURITY AND NOT THE SERFS BACKS AND FOREHEADS WHICH 
BEAT AND SHAVE AS YOU MAY ALWAYS REMAIN THE SAME BACKS 
AND FOREHEADS
NO NO A THOUSAND TIMES NO I SHALL NEVER AGREE WITH 
YOU SAID PIERREWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER XII
IN THE EVENING ANDREW AND PIERRE GOT INTO THE OPEN CAR 
RIAGE AND DROVE TO BALD HILLS PRINCE ANDREW GLANCING AT 
PIERRE BROKE THE SILENCE NOW AND THEN WITH REMARKS WHICH 
SHOWED THAT HE WAS IN A GOOD TEMPER
POINTING TO THE FIELDS HE SPOKE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS HE 
WAS MAKING IN HIS HUSBANDRY
PIERRE REMAINED GLOOMILY SILENT ANSWERING IN MONOSYL 
LABLES AND APPARENTLY IMMERSED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS
HE WAS THINKING THAT PRINCE ANDREW WAS UNHAPPY HAD 
GONE ASTRAY DID NOT SEE THE TRUE LIGHT AND THAT HE PIERRE 
OUGHT TO AID ENLIGHTEN AND RAISE HIM BUT AS SOON AS HE 
THOUGHT OF WHAT HE SHOULD SAY HE FELT THAT PRINCE ANDREW 
WITH ONE WORD ONE ARGUMENT WOULD UPSET ALL HIS TEACHING 
AND HE SHRANK FROM BEGINNING AFRAID OF EXPOSING TO POS 
SIBLE RIDICULE WHAT TO HIM WAS PRECIOUS AND SACRED
NO BUT WHY DO YOU THINK SO PIERRE SUDDENLY BEGAN 
LOWERING HIS HEAD AND LOOKING LIKE A BULL ABOUT TO CHARGE 
WHY DO YOU THINK SO YOU SHOULD NOT THINK SO
THINK WHAT ABOUT ASKED PRINCE ANDREW WITH SUR 
PRISE
ABOUT LIFE ABOUT MANS DESTINY IT CANT BE SO I MYSELF 
THOUGHT LIKE THAT AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT SAVED ME FREE 
MASONRY NO DONT SMILE FREEMASONRY IS NOT A RELIGIOUS 
CEREMONIAL SECT AS I THOUGHT IT WAS FREEMASONRY IS THE BEST  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMEXPRESSION OF THE BEST THE ETERNAL ASPECTS OF HUMANITY
AND HE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN FREEMASONRY AS HE UNDERSTOOD IT 
TO PRINCE ANDREW HE SAID THAT FREEMASONRY IS THE TEACHING 
OF CHRISTIANITY FREED FROM THE BONDS OF STATE AND CHURCH A 
TEACHING OF EQUALITY BROTHERHOOD AND LOVE
ONLY OUR HOLY BROTHERHOOD HAS THE REAL MEANING OF LIFE ALL 
THE REST IS A DREAM SAID PIERRE UNDERSTAND MY DEAR FELLOW 
THAT OUTSIDE THIS UNION ALL IS FILLED WITH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD 
AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT NOTHING IS LEFT FOR AN INTELLIGENT AND 
GOOD MAN BUT TO LIVE OUT HIS LIFE LIKE YOU MERELY TRYING NOT 
TO HARM OTHERS BUT MAKE OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONVICTIONS YOUR 
OWN JOIN OUR BROTHERHOOD GIVE YOURSELF UP TO US LET YOUR 
SELF BE GUIDED AND YOU WILL AT ONCE FEEL YOURSELF AS I HAVE 
FELT MYSELF A PART OF THAT VAST INVISIBLE CHAIN THE BEGINNING 
OF WHICH IS HIDDEN IN HEAVEN SAID PIERRE
PRINCE ANDREW LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM LISTENED 
IN SILENCE TO PIERRES WORDS MORE THAN ONCE WHEN THE NOISE 
OF THE WHEELS PREVENTED HIS CATCHING WHAT PIERRE SAID HE 
ASKED HIM TO REPEAT IT AND BY THE PECULIAR GLOW THAT CAME 
INTO PRINCE ANDREWS EYES AND BY HIS SILENCE PIERRE SAW THAT 
HIS WORDS WERE NOT IN VAIN AND THAT PRINCE ANDREW WOULD 
NOT INTERRUPT HIM OR LAUGH AT WHAT HE SAID

WAS GOING BADLY
ROSTOV LIVED AS BEFORE WITH DENISOV AND SINCE THEIR FUR 
LOUGH THEY HAD BECOME MORE FRIENDLY THAN EVER DENISOV 
NEVER SPOKE OF ROSTOVS FAMILY BUT BY THE TENDER FRIEND

TO THEM THE PRETTY POLISH GIRL HE HAD SAVED ROSTOV TOOK THE 
JOKE AS AN INSULT FLARED UP AND SAID SUCH UNPLEASANT THINGS 
TO THE OFFICER THAT IT WAS ALL DENISOV COULD DO TO PREVENT A 
DUEL WHEN THE OFFICER HAD GONE AWAY DENISOV WHO DID NOT 
HIMSELF KNOW WHAT ROSTOVS RELATIONS WITH THE POLISH GIRL 
MIGHT BE BEGAN TO UPBRAID HIM FOR HIS QUICKNESS OF TEMPER 
AND ROSTOV REPLIED
SAY WHAT YOU LIKE SHE IS LIKE A SISTER TO ME AND I CANT 
TELL YOU HOW IT OFFENDED ME BECAUSE WELL FOR THAT REA 
SON

FIFTYTHREE MINUTES HE NOTED THIS DOWN THAT SAME EVENING 
AMONG OTHER FACTS HE FELT TO BE OF HISTORIC IMPORTANCE AS THE 
EMPERORS SUITE WAS A VERY SMALL ONE IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT 
IMPORTANCE FOR A MAN WHO VALUED HIS SUCCESS IN THE SER 
VICE TO BE AT TILSIT ON THE OCCASION OF THIS INTERVIEW BETWEEN 
THE TWO EMPERORS AND HAVING SUCCEEDED IN THIS BORIS FELT 
THAT HENCEFORTH HIS POSITION WAS FULLY ASSURED HE HAD NOT 
ONLY BECOME KNOWN BUT PEOPLE HAD GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO 
HIM AND ACCEPTED HIM TWICE HE HAD EXECUTED COMMISSIONS 
TO THE EMPEROR HIMSELF SO THAT THE LATTER KNEW HIS FACE AND 
ALL THOSE AT COURT FAR FROM COLDSHOULDERING HIM AS AT FIRST 
WHEN THEY CONSIDERED HIM A NEWCOMER WOULD NOW HAVE 
BEEN SURPRISED HAD HE BEEN ABSENT
BORIS LODGED WITH ANOTHER ADJUTANT THE POLISH COUNT 
ZHILINSKI ZHILINSKI A POLE BROUGHT UP IN PARIS WAS RICH 
AND PASSIONATELY FOND OF THE FRENCH AND ALMOST EVERY DAY  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMOF THE STAY AT TILSIT FRENCH OFFICERS OF THE GUARD AND FROM 
FRENCH HEADQUARTERS WERE DINING AND LUNCHING WITH HIM 
AND BORIS
ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTYFOURTH OF JUNE COUNT ZHI

HONOR WAS AN AIDEDECAMP OF NAPOLEONS THERE WERE ALSO 
SEVERAL FRENCH OFFICERS OF THE GUARD AND A PAGE OF NAPO 
LEONS A YOUNG LAD OF AN OLD ARISTOCRATIC FRENCH FAMILY THAT 
SAME DAY ROSTOV PROFITING BY THE DARKNESS TO AVOID BEING 
RECOGNIZED IN CIVILIAN DRESS CAME TO TILSIT AND WENT TO THE 
LODGING OCCUPIED BY BORIS AND ZHILINSKI
ROSTOV IN COMMON WITH THE WHOLE ARMY FROM WHICH 
HE CAME WAS FAR FROM HAVING EXPERIENCED THE CHANGE OF 
FEELING TOWARD NAPOLEON AND THE FRENCHWHO FROM BEING 
FOES HAD SUDDENLY BECOME FRIENDSTHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AT 
HEADQUARTERS AND IN BORIS IN THE ARMY BONAPARTE AND THE 
FRENCH WERE STILL REGARDED WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF ANGER 
CONTEMPT AND FEAR ONLY RECENTLY TALKING WITH ONE OF PLA 
TOVS COSSACK OFFICERS ROSTOV HAD ARGUED THAT IF NAPOLEON 
WERE TAKEN PRISONER HE WOULD BE TREATED NOT AS A SOVEREIGN 
BUT AS A CRIMINAL QUITE LATELY HAPPENING TO MEET A WOUND 
ED FRENCH COLONEL ON THE ROAD ROSTOV HAD MAINTAINED 
WITH HEAT THAT PEACE WAS IMPOSSIBLE BETWEEN A LEGITIMATE 
SOVEREIGN AND THE CRIMINAL BONAPARTE ROSTOV WAS THERE 
FORE UNPLEASANTLY STRUCK BY THE PRESENCE OF FRENCH OFFICERS 
IN BORIS LODGING DRESSED IN UNIFORMS HE HAD BEEN ACCUS 
TOMED TO SEE FROM QUITE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW FROM THE 
OUTPOSTS OF THE FLANK AS SOON AS HE NOTICED A FRENCH OFFICER 
WHO THRUST HIS HEAD OUT OF THE DOOR THAT WARLIKE FEELING OF WAR AND PEACE HOSTILITY WHICH HE ALWAYS EXPERIENCED AT THE SIGHT OF THE EN 
EMY SUDDENLY SEIZED HIM HE STOPPED AT THE THRESHOLD AND 
ASKED IN RUSSIAN WHETHER DRUBETSKOY LIVED THERE BORIS 
HEARING A STRANGE VOICE IN THE ANTEROOM CAME OUT TO MEET 
HIM AN EXPRESSION OF ANNOYANCE SHOWED ITSELF FOR A MO 
MENT ON HIS FACE ON FIRST RECOGNIZING ROSTOV
AH ITS YOU VERY GLAD VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU HE SAID 
HOWEVER COMING TOWARD HIM WITH A SMILE BUT ROSTOV HAD 
NOTICED HIS FIRST IMPULSE
IVE COME AT A BAD TIME I THINK I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME 
BUT I HAVE BUSINESS HE SAID COLDLY
NO I ONLY WONDER HOW YOU MANAGED TO GET AWAY FROM 
YOUR REGIMENT DANS UN MOMENT JE SUIS A VOUS HE SAID 
ANSWERING SOMEONE WHO CALLED HIM
IN A MINUTE I SHALL BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
I SEE IM INTRUDING ROSTOV REPEATED
THE LOOK OF ANNOYANCE HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED FROM 
BORIS FACE HAVING EVIDENTLY REFLECTED AND DECIDED HOW TO 
ACT HE VERY QUIETLY TOOK BOTH ROSTOVS HANDS AND LED HIM 
INTO THE NEXT ROOM HIS EYES LOOKING SERENELY AND STEADILY 
AT ROSTOV SEEMED TO BE VEILED BY SOMETHING AS IF SCREENED 
BY BLUE SPECTACLES OF CONVENTIONALITY SO IT SEEMED TO ROS 
TOV
OH COME NOW AS IF YOU COULD COME AT A WRONG TIME 
SAID BORIS AND HE LED HIM INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE SUPPER 
TABLE WAS LAID AND INTRODUCED HIM TO HIS GUESTS EXPLAINING 
THAT HE WAS NOT A CIVILIAN BUT AN HUSSAR OFFICER AND AN OLD 
FRIEND OF HIS
COUNT ZHILINSKILE COMTE N NLE CAPITAINE S S SAID HE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMNAMING HIS GUESTS ROSTOV LOOKED FROWNINGLY AT THE FRENCH 
MEN BOWED RELUCTANTLY AND REMAINED SILENT
ZHILINSKI EVIDENTLY DID NOT RECEIVE THIS NEW RUSSIAN PER 
SON VERY WILLINGLY INTO HIS CIRCLE AND DID NOT SPEAK TO ROSTOV 
BORIS DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE THE CONSTRAINT THE NEWCOMER 
PRODUCED AND WITH THE SAME PLEASANT COMPOSURE AND THE 
SAME VEILED LOOK IN HIS EYES WITH WHICH HE HAD MET ROSTOV 
TRIED TO ENLIVEN THE CONVERSATION ONE OF THE FRENCHMEN 
WITH THE POLITENESS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS COUNTRYMEN AD 
DRESSED THE OBSTINATELY TACITURN ROSTOV SAYING THAT THE 
LATTER HAD PROBABLY COME TO TILSIT TO SEE THE EMPEROR
NO I CAME ON BUSINESS REPLIED ROSTOV BRIEFLY
ROSTOV HAD BEEN OUT OF HUMOR FROM THE MOMENT HE NO 
TICED THE LOOK OF DISSATISFACTION ON BORIS FACE AND AS ALWAYS 
HAPPENS TO THOSE IN A BAD HUMOR IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT 
EVERYONE REGARDED HIM WITH AVERSION AND THAT HE WAS IN EV 
ERYBODYS WAY HE REALLY WAS IN THEIR WAY FOR HE ALONE TOOK 
NO PART IN THE CONVERSATION WHICH AGAIN BECAME GENERAL 
THE LOOKS THE VISITORS CAST ON HIM SEEMED TO SAY AND WHAT 
IS HE SITTING HERE FOR HE ROSE AND WENT UP TO BORIS
ANYHOW IM IN YOUR WAY HE SAID IN A LOW TONE COME 
AND TALK OVER MY BUSINESS AND ILL GO AWAY
OH NO NOT AT ALL SAID BORIS BUT IF YOU ARE TIRED COME 
AND LIE DOWN IN MY ROOM AND HAVE A REST
YES REALLY
THEY WENT INTO THE LITTLE ROOM WHERE BORIS SLEPT ROSTOV 
WITHOUT SITTING DOWN BEGAN AT ONCE IRRITABLY AS IF BORIS 
WERE TO BLAME IN SOME WAY TELLING HIM ABOUT DENISOVS 
AFFAIR ASKING HIM WHETHER THROUGH HIS GENERAL HE COULD WAR AND PEACE AND WOULD INTERCEDE WITH THE EMPEROR ON DENISOVS BEHALF 
AND GET DENISOVS PETITION HANDED IN WHEN HE AND BORIS 
WERE ALONE ROSTOV FELT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HE COULD NOT 
LOOK BORIS IN THE FACE WITHOUT A SENSE OF AWKWARDNESS BO 
RIS WITH ONE LEG CROSSED OVER THE OTHER AND STROKING HIS LEFT  
HAND WITH THE SLENDER FINGERS OF HIS RIGHT LISTENED TO ROSTOV 
AS A GENERAL LISTENS TO THE REPORT OF A SUBORDINATE NOW LOOK 
ING ASIDE AND NOW GAZING STRAIGHT INTO ROSTOVS EYES WITH 
THE SAME VEILED LOOK EACH TIME THIS HAPPENED ROSTOV FELT 
UNCOMFORTABLE AND CAST DOWN HIS EYES
I HAVE HEARD OF SUCH CASES AND KNOW THAT HIS MAJESTY 
IS VERY SEVERE IN SUCH AFFAIRS I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST NOT TO 
BRING IT BEFORE THE EMPEROR BUT TO APPLY TO THE COMMANDER 
OF THE CORPS BUT IN GENERAL I THINK
SO YOU DONT WANT TO DO ANYTHING WELL THEN SAY SO 
ROSTOV ALMOST SHOUTED NOT LOOKING BORIS IN THE FACE
BORIS SMILED
ON THE CONTRARY I WILL DO WHAT I CAN ONLY I THOUGHT
AT THAT MOMENT ZHILINSKIS VOICE WAS HEARD CALLING BO 
RIS
WELL THEN GO GO GO SAID ROSTOV AND REFUSING SUPPER 
AND REMAINING ALONE IN THE LITTLE ROOM HE WALKED UP AND 
DOWN FOR A LONG TIME HEARING THE LIGHTHEARTED FRENCH CON 
VERSATION FROM THE NEXT ROOM
CHAPTER XX
ROSTOV HAD COME TO TILSIT THE DAY LEAST SUITABLE FOR A PE 
TITION ON DENISOVS BEHALF HE COULD NOT HIMSELF GO TO THE 
GENERAL IN ATTENDANCE AS HE WAS IN MUFTI AND HAD COME TO 
TILSIT WITHOUT PERMISSION TO DO SO AND BORIS EVEN HAD HE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMWISHED TO COULD NOT HAVE DONE SO ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ON 
THAT DAY JUNE  THE PRELIMINARIES OF PEACE WERE SIGNED 
THE EMPERORS EXCHANGED DECORATIONS ALEXANDER RECEIVED 
THE CROSS OF THE LEGION OF HONOR AND NAPOLEON THE ORDER 
OF ST ANDREW OF THE FIRST DEGREE AND A DINNER HAD BEEN AR 
RANGED FOR THE EVENING GIVEN BY A BATTALION OF THE FRENCH 
GUARDS TO THE PREOBRAZHENSK BATTALION THE EMPERORS WERE 
TO BE PRESENT AT THAT BANQUET
ROSTOV FELT SO ILL AT EASE AND UNCOMFORTABLE WITH BORIS 
THAT WHEN THE LATTER LOOKED IN AFTER SUPPER HE PRETENDED 
TO BE ASLEEP AND EARLY NEXT MORNING WENT AWAY AVOIDING 
BORIS IN HIS CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND A ROUND HAT HE WANDERED 
ABOUT THE TOWN STARING AT THE FRENCH AND THEIR UNIFORMS 
AND AT THE STREETS AND HOUSES WHERE THE RUSSIAN AND FRENCH 
EMPERORS WERE STAYING IN A SQUARE HE SAW TABLES BEING SET 
UP AND PREPARATIONS MADE FOR THE DINNER HE SAW THE RUS 
SIAN AND FRENCH COLORS DRAPED FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF THE 
STREETS WITH HUGH MONOGRAMS A AND N IN THE WINDOWS OF 
THE HOUSES ALSO FLAGS AND BUNTING WERE DISPLAYED
BORIS DOESNT WANT TO HELP ME AND I DONT WANT TO ASK 
HIM THATS SETTLED THOUGHT NICHOLAS ALL IS OVER BETWEEN 
US BUT I WONT LEAVE HERE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ALL I CAN FOR 
DENISOV AND CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT GETTING HIS LETTER TO THE 
EMPEROR THE EMPEROR HE IS HERE THOUGHT ROSTOV WHO 
HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE ALEXANDER 
LODGED
SADDLED HORSES WERE STANDING BEFORE THE HOUSE AND THE 
SUITE WERE ASSEMBLING EVIDENTLY PREPARING FOR THE EMPEROR 
TO COME OUTWAR AND PEACE I MAY SEE HIM AT ANY MOMENT THOUGHT ROSTOV IF ONLY I 
WERE TO HAND THE LETTER DIRECT TO HIM AND TELL HIM ALL COULD 
THEY REALLY ARREST ME FOR MY CIVILIAN CLOTHES SURELY NOT HE 
WOULD UNDERSTAND ON WHOSE SIDE JUSTICE LIES HE UNDERSTANDS 
EVERYTHING KNOWS EVERYTHING WHO CAN BE MORE JUST MORE 
MAGNANIMOUS THAN HE AND EVEN IF THEY DID ARREST ME FOR 
BEING HERE WHAT WOULD IT MATTER THOUGHT HE LOOKING AT AN 
OFFICER WHO WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE THE EMPEROR OCCUPIED 
AFTER ALL PEOPLE DO GO IN ITS ALL NONSENSE ILL GO IN AND 
HAND THE LETTER TO THE EMPEROR MYSELF SO MUCH THE WORSE 
FOR DRUBETSKOY WHO DRIVES ME TO IT AND SUDDENLY WITH A 
DETERMINATION HE HIMSELF DID NOT EXPECT ROSTOV FELT FOR THE 
LETTER IN HIS POCKET AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOUSE
NO I WONT MISS MY OPPORTUNITY NOW AS I DID AFTER 
AUSTERLITZ HE THOUGHT EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO MEET 
THE MONARCH AND CONSCIOUS OF THE BLOOD THAT RUSHED TO HIS 
HEART AT THE THOUGHT I WILL FALL AT HIS FEET AND BESEECH HIM 
HE WILL LIFT ME UP WILL LISTEN AND WILL EVEN THANK ME I AM 
HAPPY WHEN I CAN DO GOOD BUT TO REMEDY INJUSTICE IS THE 
GREATEST HAPPINESS ROSTOV FANCIED THE SOVEREIGN SAYING 
AND PASSING PEOPLE WHO LOOKED AFTER HIM WITH CURIOSITY HE 
ENTERED THE PORCH OF THE EMPERORS HOUSE
A BROAD STAIRCASE LED STRAIGHT UP FROM THE ENTRY AND TO 
THE RIGHT HE SAW A CLOSED DOOR BELOW UNDER THE STAIRCASE 
WAS A DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER FLOOR
WHOM DO YOU WANT SOMEONE INQUIRED
TO HAND IN A LETTER A PETITION TO HIS MAJESTY SAID NICH 
OLAS WITH A TREMOR IN HIS VOICE
A PETITION THIS WAY TO THE OFFICER THE OFFICER ON DUTY  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMHE WAS SHOWN THE DOOR LEADING DOWNSTAIRS ONLY IT WONT 
BE ACCEPTED
ON HEARING THIS INDIFFERENT VOICE ROSTOV GREW FRIGHTENED 
AT WHAT HE WAS DOING THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE EMPER 
OR AT ANY MOMENT WAS SO FASCINATING AND CONSEQUENTLY SO 
ALARMING THAT HE WAS READY TO RUN AWAY BUT THE OFFICIAL WHO 
HAD QUESTIONED HIM OPENED THE DOOR AND ROSTOV ENTERED
A SHORT STOUT MAN OF ABOUT THIRTY IN WHITE BREECHES AND 
HIGH BOOTS AND A BATISTE SHIRT THAT HE HAD EVIDENTLY ONLY JUST 
PUT ON STANDING IN THAT ROOM AND HIS VALET WAS BUTTON 
ING ON TO THE BACK OF HIS BREECHES A NEW PAIR OF HANDSOME 
SILKEMBROIDERED BRACES THAT FOR SOME REASON ATTRACTED 
ROSTOVS ATTENTION THIS MAN WAS WAS SPEAKING TO SOMEONE 
IN THE ADJOINING ROOM
A GOOD FIGURE AND IN HER FIRST BLOOM HE WAS SAYING BUT 
ON SEEING ROSTOV HE STOPPED SHORT AND FROWNED
WHAT IS IT A PETITION

ANOTHER PETITIONER ANSWERED THE MAN WITH THE BRACES
TELL HIM TO COME LATER HELL BE COMING OUT DIRECTLY WE 
MUST GO

BRACES STOPPED HIM

PORCH THERE WERE MANY OFFICERS AND GENERALS IN FULL PARADE

CURSING HIS TEMERITY HIS HEART SINKING AT THE THOUGHT OF 
FINDING HIMSELF AT ANY MOMENT FACE TO FACE WITH THE EM

FULLY ALIVE NOW TO THE IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT AND RE 
PENTING OF IT ROSTOV WITH DOWNCAST EYES WAS MAKING HIS 
WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE THROUGH THE BRILLIANT SUITE WHEN A FA 
MILIAR VOICE CALLED HIM AND A HAND DETAINED HIM

DEEP VOICE
IT WAS A CAVALRY GENERAL WHO HAD OBTAINED THE EMPERORS 
SPECIAL FAVOR DURING THIS CAMPAIGN AND WHO HAD FORMERLY 
COMMANDED THE DIVISION IN WHICH ROSTOV WAS SERVING
ROSTOV IN DISMAY BEGAN JUSTIFYING HIMSELF BUT SEEING 
THE KINDLY JOCULAR FACE OF THE GENERAL HE TOOK HIM ASIDE AND 
IN AN EXCITED VOICE TOLD HIM THE WHOLE AFFAIR ASKING HIM 
TO INTERCEDE FOR DENISOV WHOM THE GENERAL KNEW HAVING 
HEARD ROSTOV TO THE END THE GENERAL SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVE 
LY

ROSTOV HOW DYOU DO WE MISSED ONE ANOTHER HE SAID 
AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ASKING WHAT WAS THE MATTER SO 
STRANGELY DISMAL AND TROUBLED WAS ROSTOVS FACE
NOTHING NOTHING REPLIED ROSTOV
YOULL CALL ROUND
YES I WILL
ROSTOV STOOD AT THAT CORNER FOR A LONG TIME WATCHING 
THE FEAST FROM A DISTANCE A DISTANCE IN HIS MIND A PAINFUL 
PROCESS WAS GOING ON WHICH HE COULD NOT BRING TO A CONCLU 
SION TERRIBLE DOUBTS ROSE IN HIS SOUL NOW HE REMEMBERED 
DENISOV WITH HIS CHANGED EXPRESSION HIS SUBMISSION AND 
THE WHOLE HOSPITAL WITH ARMS AND LEGS TORN OFF AND ITS DIRT 
AND DISEASE SO VIVIDLY DID HE RECALL THAT HOSPITAL STENCH OF WAR AND PEACE DEAD FLESH THAT HE LOOKED ROUND TO SEE WHERE THE SMELL CAME 
FROM NEXT HE THOUGHT OF THAT SELFSATISFIED BONAPARTE WITH 
HIS SMALL WHITE HAND WHO WAS NOW AN EMPEROR LIKED AND 
RESPECTED BY ALEXANDER THEN WHY THOSE SEVERED ARMS AND 
LEGS AND THOSE DEAD MEN THEN AGAIN HE THOUGHT OF LAZA 
REV REWARDED AND DENISOV PUNISHED AND UNPARDONED HE 
CAUGHT HIMSELF HARBORING SUCH STRANGE THOUGHTS THAT HE WAS 
FRIGHTENED
THE SMELL OF THE FOOD THE PREOBRAZHENSKIS WERE EATING 
AND A SENSE OF HUNGER RECALLED HIM FROM THESE REFLECTIONS 
HE HAD TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT BEFORE GOING AWAY HE WENT 
TO A HOTEL HE HAD NOTICED THAT MORNING THERE HE FOUND SO 
MANY PEOPLE AMONG THEM OFFICERS WHO LIKE HIMSELF HAD 
COME IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES THAT HE HAD DIFFICULTY IN GETTING 
A DINNER TWO OFFICERS OF HIS OWN DIVISION JOINED HIM THE 
CONVERSATION NATURALLY TURNED ON THE PEACE THE OFFICERS HIS 
COMRADES LIKE MOST OF THE ARMY WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE 
PEACE CONCLUDED AFTER THE BATTLE OF FRIEDLAND THEY SAID THAT

ACTIONS WHAT RIGHT HAVE WE TO ARGUE WE CANNOT COMPRE 
HEND EITHER THE EMPERORS OR HIS ACTIONS
BUT I NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT THE EMPEROR SAID THE OF 
FICER JUSTIFYING HIMSELF AND UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND ROSTOVS 
OUTBURST EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE WAS DRUNK
BUT ROSTOV DID NOT LISTEN TO HIM
WE ARE NOT DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS WE ARE SOLDIERS AND 
NOTHING MORE HE WENT ON IF WE ARE ORDERED TO DIE WE 
MUST DIE IF WERE PUNISHED IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE DESERVED 
IT ITS NOT FOR US TO JUDGE IF THE EMPEROR PLEASES TO RECOG 
NIZE BONAPARTE AS EMPEROR AND TO CONCLUDE AN ALLIANCE 
WITH HIM IT MEANS THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF ONCE 
WE BEGIN JUDGING AND ARGUING ABOUT EVERYTHING NOTHING

WHOLE PROVINCE WITH HUNTS THEATRICALS DINNERS AND MUSIC 
HE WAS GLAD TO SEE PRINCE ANDREW AS HE WAS TO SEE ANY NEW

DURING THE DULL DAY IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HE WAS ENTER 
TAINED BY HIS ELDERLY HOSTS AND BY THE MORE IMPORTANT OF THE 
VISITORS THE OLD COUNTS HOUSE WAS CROWDED ON ACCOUNT OF AN 
APPROACHING NAME DAY PRINCE ANDREW REPEATEDLY GLANCED 
AT NATASHA GAY AND LAUGHING AMONG THE YOUNGER MEMBERS

ABLE TO SLEEP HE READ AWHILE AND THEN PUT OUT HIS CANDLE BUT 
RELIT IT IT WAS HOT IN THE ROOM THE INSIDE SHUTTERS OF WHICH 
WERE CLOSED HE WAS CROSS WITH THE STUPID OLD MAN AS HE 
CALLED ROSTOV WHO HAD MADE HIM STAY BY ASSURING HIM THAT 
SOME NECESSARY DOCUMENTS HAD NOT YET ARRIVED FROM TOWN 
AND HE WAS VEXED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING STAYED
HE GOT UP AND WENT TO THE WINDOW TO OPEN IT AS SOON AS 
HE OPENED THE SHUTTERS THE MOONLIGHT AS IF IT HAD LONG BEEN 
WATCHING FOR THIS BURST INTO THE ROOM HE OPENED THE CASE 
MENT THE NIGHT WAS FRESH BRIGHT AND VERY STILL JUST BEFORE 
THE WINDOW WAS A ROW OF POLLARD TREES LOOKING BLACK ON ONE 
SIDE AND WITH A SILVERY LIGHT ON THE OTHER BENEATH THE TREES WAR AND PEACE GREWSOME KIND OF LUSH WET BUSHY VEGETATION WITH SILVERLIT 
LEAVES AND STEMS HERE AND THERE FARTHER BACK BEYOND THE

TREE WITH BRILLIANTLY WHITE TRUNK AND BRANCHES AND ABOVE IT 
SHONE THE MOON NEARLY AT ITS FULL IN A PALE ALMOST STARLESS 
SPRING SKY PRINCE ANDREW LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW 
LEDGE AND HIS EYES RESTED ON THAT SKY
HIS ROOM WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR THOSE IN THE ROOMS ABOVE 
WERE ALSO AWAKE HE HEARD FEMALE VOICES OVERHEAD
JUST ONCE MORE SAID A GIRLISH VOICE ABOVE HIM WHICH 
PRINCE ANDREW RECOGNIZED AT ONCE
BUT WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO BED REPLIED ANOTHER

STILL SITTING THERE FROM TIME TO TIME HE HEARD A SOFT RUSTLE

CLAIMED TO BED THEN IF IT MUST BE AND SHE SLAMMED THE 
CASEMENT
FOR HER I MIGHT AS WELL NOT EXIST THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW 
WHILE HE LISTENED TO HER VOICE FOR SOME REASON EXPECTING YET 
FEARING THAT SHE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THERE SHE 
IS AGAIN AS IF IT WERE ON PURPOSE THOUGHT HE
IN HIS SOUL THERE SUDDENLY AROSE SUCH AN UNEXPECTED TUR 
MOIL OF YOUTHFUL THOUGHTS AND HOPES CONTRARY TO THE WHOLE 
TENOR OF HIS LIFE THAT UNABLE TO EXPLAIN HIS CONDITION TO HIM 
SELF HE LAY DOWN AND FELL ASLEEP AT ONCEWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER III
NEXT MORNING HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF NO ONE BUT THE 
COUNT AND NOT WAITING FOR THE LADIES TO APPEAR PRINCE AN 
DREW SET OFF FOR HOME
IT WAS ALREADY THE BEGINNING OF JUNE WHEN ON HIS RETURN 
JOURNEY HE DROVE INTO THE BIRCH FOREST WHERE THE GNARLED OLD 
OAK HAD MADE SO STRANGE AND MEMORABLE AN IMPRESSION ON 
HIM IN THE FOREST THE HARNESS BELLS SOUNDED YET MORE MUF 
FLED THAN THEY HAD DONE SIX WEEKS BEFORE FOR NOW ALL WAS 
THICK SHADY AND DENSE AND THE YOUNG FIRS DOTTED ABOUT 
IN THE FOREST DID NOT JAR ON THE GENERAL BEAUTY BUT LENDING 
THEMSELVES TO THE MOOD AROUND WERE DELICATELY GREEN WITH 
FLUFFY YOUNG SHOOTS
THE WHOLE DAY HAD BEEN HOT SOMEWHERE A STORM WAS 
GATHERING BUT ONLY A SMALL CLOUD HAD SCATTERED SOME RAIN 
DROPS LIGHTLY SPRINKLING THE ROAD AND THE SAPPY LEAVES THE 
LEFT SIDE OF THE FOREST WAS DARK IN THE SHADE THE RIGHT SIDE 
GLITTERED IN THE SUNLIGHT WET AND SHINY AND SCARCELY SWAYED 
BY THE BREEZE EVERYTHING WAS IN BLOSSOM THE NIGHTINGALES 
TRILLED AND THEIR VOICES REVERBERATED NOW NEAR NOW FAR 
AWAY
YES HERE IN THIS FOREST WAS THAT OAK WITH WHICH I AGREED 
THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW BUT WHERE IS IT HE AGAIN WONDERED 
GAZING AT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WITHOUT RECOGNIZING 
IT HE LOOKED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE VERY OAK HE SOUGHT THE  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMOLD OAK QUITE TRANSFIGURED SPREADING OUT A CANOPY OF SAP 
PY DARKGREEN FOLIAGE STOOD RAPT AND SLIGHTLY TREMBLING IN 
THE RAYS OF THE EVENING SUN NEITHER GNARLED FINGERS NOR OLD 
SCARS NOR OLD DOUBTS AND SORROWS WERE ANY OF THEM IN EVI 
DENCE NOW THROUGH THE HARD CENTURYOLD BARK EVEN WHERE 
THERE WERE NO TWIGS LEAVES HAD SPROUTED SUCH AS ONE COULD 
HARDLY BELIEVE THE OLD VETERAN COULD HAVE PRODUCED
YES IT IS THE SAME OAK THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW AND ALL 
AT ONCE HE WAS SEIZED BY AN UNREASONING SPRINGTIME FEELING 
OF JOY AND RENEWAL ALL THE BEST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE SUD 
DENLY ROSE TO HIS MEMORY AUSTERLITZ WITH THE LOFTY HEAVENS 
HIS WIFES DEAD REPROACHFUL FACE PIERRE AT THE FERRY THAT GIRL 
THRILLED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT AND THAT NIGHT ITSELF AND 
THE MOON AND ALL THIS RUSHED SUDDENLY TO HIS MIND
NO LIFE IS NOT OVER AT THIRTYONE PRINCE ANDREW SUD 
DENLY DECIDED FINALLY AND DECISIVELY IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME 
TO KNOW WHAT I HAVE IN MEEVERYONE MUST KNOW IT PIERRE 
AND THAT YOUNG GIRL WHO WANTED TO FLY AWAY INTO THE SKY EV 
ERYONE MUST KNOW ME SO THAT MY LIFE MAY NOT BE LIVED FOR 
MYSELF ALONE WHILE OTHERS LIVE SO APART FROM IT BUT SO THAT 
IT MAY BE REFLECTED IN THEM ALL AND THEY AND I MAY LIVE IN 
HARMONY
ON REACHING HOME PRINCE ANDREW DECIDED TO GO TO PE 
TERSBURG THAT AUTUMN AND FOUND ALL SORTS OF REASONS FOR THIS 
DECISION A WHOLE SERICS OF SENSIBLE AND LOGICAL CONSIDER 
ATIONS SHOWING IT TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR HIM TO GO TO PETERSBURG 
AND EVEN TO REENTER THE SERVICE KEPT SPRINGING UP IN HIS 
MIND HE COULD NOT NOW UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD EVER 
EVEN HAVE DOUBTED THE NECESSITY OF TAKING AN ACTIVE SHARE WAR AND PEACE IN LIFE JUST AS A MONTH BEFORE HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD HOW 
THE IDEA OF LEAVING THE QUIET COUNTRY COULD EVER ENTER HIS 
HEAD IT NOW SEEMED CLEAR TO HIM THAT ALL HIS EXPERIENCE OF 
LIFE MUST BE SENSELESSLY WASTED UNLESS HE APPLIED IT TO SOME 
KIND OF WORK AND AGAIN PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN LIFE HE DID 
NOT EVEN REMEMBER HOW FORMERLY ON THE STRENGTH OF SIMILAR 
WRETCHED LOGICAL ARGUMENTS IT HAD SEEMED OBVIOUS THAT HE 
WOULD BE DEGRADING HIMSELF IF HE NOW AFTER THE LESSONS HE 
HAD HAD IN LIFE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY 
OF BEING USEFUL AND IN THE POSSIBILITY OF HAPPINESS OR LOVE 
NOW REASON SUGGESTED QUITE THE OPPOSITE AFTER THAT JOURNEY 
TO RYAZAN HE FOUND THE COUNTRY DULL HIS FORMER PURSUITS NO 
LONGER INTERESTED HIM AND OFTEN WHEN SITTING ALONE IN HIS 
STUDY HE GOT UP WENT TO THE MIRROR AND GAZED A LONG TIME AT 
HIS OWN FACE THEN HE WOULD TURN AWAY TO THE PORTRAIT OF HIS 
DEAD LISE WHO WITH HAIR CURLED A LA GRECQUE LOOKED TENDERLY 
AND GAILY AT HIM OUT OF THE GILT FRAME SHE DID NOT NOW SAY 
THOSE FORMER TERRIBLE WORDS TO HIM BUT LOOKED SIMPLY MER 
RILY AND INQUISITIVELY AT HIM AND PRINCE ANDREW CROSSING 
HIS ARMS BEHIND HIM LONG PACED THE ROOM NOW FROWNING 
NOW SMILING AS HE REFLECTED ON THOSE IRRATIONAL INEXPRESS 
IBLE THOUGHTS SECRET AS A CRIME WHICH ALTERED HIS WHOLE LIFE 
AND WERE CONNECTED WITH PIERRE WITH FAME WITH THE GIRL AT 
THE WINDOW THE OAK AND WOMANS BEAUTY AND LOVE AND IF 
ANYONE CAME INTO HIS ROOM AT SUCH MOMENTS HE WAS PARTIC 
ULARLY COLD STERN AND ABOVE ALL UNPLEASANTLY LOGICAL
MY DEAR PRINCESS MARY ENTERING AT SUCH A MOMENT 
WOULD SAY LITTLE NICHOLAS CANT GO OUT TODAY ITS VERY COLD
IF IT WERE HOT PRINCE ANDREW WOULD REPLY AT SUCH TIMES  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMVERY DRYLY TO HIS SISTER HE COULD GO OUT IN HIS SMOCK BUT AS 
IT IS COLD HE MUST WEAR WARM CLOTHES WHICH WERE DESIGNED 
FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT IS WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THE FACT THAT IT IS 
COLD AND NOT THAT A CHILD WHO NEEDS FRESH AIR SHOULD REMAIN 
AT HOME HE WOULD ADD WITH EXTREME LOGIC AS IF PUNISH 
ING SOMEONE FOR THOSE SECRET ILLOGICAL EMOTIONS THAT STIRRED 
WITHIN HIM
AT SUCH MOMENTS PRINCESS MARY WOULD THINK HOW INTEL 
LECTUAL WORK DRIES MEN UPWAR AND PEACE CHAPTER IV
PRINCE ANDREW ARRIVED IN PETERSBURG IN AUGUST  
IT WAS THE TIME WHEN THE YOUTHFUL SPERANSKI WAS AT THE ZE 
NITH OF HIS FAME AND HIS REFORMS WERE BEING PUSHED FORWARD 
WITH THE GREATEST ENERGY THAT SAME AUGUST THE EMPEROR

TIPATHETIC TO THE EMPEROR AND THAT THE LATTER DISLIKED HIS FACE

OF THIS SURMISE THE COURTIERS EXPLAINED THE EMPERORS NE 
GLECT OF HIM BY HIS MAJESTYS DISPLEASURE AT BOLKONSKIS NOT 
HAVING SERVED SINCE 
I KNOW MYSELF THAT ONE CANNOT HELP ONES SYMPATHIES 
AND ANTIPATHIES THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW SO IT WILL NOT DO

ON THE APPOINTED DAY PRINCE ANDREW ENTERED COUNT 
ARAKCHEEVS WAITING ROOM AT NINE IN THE MORNING
HE DID NOT KNOW ARAKCHEEV PERSONALLY HAD NEVER SEEN 
HIM AND ALL HE HAD HEARD OF HIM INSPIRED HIM WITH BUT LITTLE 
RESPECT FOR THE MAN
HE IS MINISTER OF WAR A MAN TRUSTED BY THE EMPEROR 
AND I NEED NOT CONCERN MYSELF ABOUT HIS PERSONAL QUALI 
TIES HE HAS BEEN COMMISSIONED TO CONSIDER MY PROJECT SO

RECEIVED AN IRONICAL LOOK AND WAS TOLD THAT HIS TURN WOULD 
COME IN DUE COURSE AFTER SOME OTHERS HAD BEEN SHOWN IN 
AND OUT OF THE MINISTERS ROOM BY THE ADJUTANT ON DUTY AN 
OFFICER WHO STRUCK PRINCE ANDREW BY HIS HUMILIATED AND 
FRIGHTENED AIR WAS ADMITTED AT THAT TERRIBLE DOOR THIS OFFI

QUAINTANCES PARTICULARLY THOSE HE KNEW TO BE IN POWER 
AND WHOSE AID HE MIGHT NEED IN PETERSBURG HE NOW EXPE 
RIENCED THE SAME FEELING HE HAD HAD ON THE EVE OF A BATTLE 
WHEN TROUBLED BY ANXIOUS CURIOSITY AND IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACT 
ED TO THE RULING CIRCLES WHERE THE FUTURE ON WHICH THE FATE 
OF MILLIONS DEPENDED WAS BEING SHAPED FROM THE IRRITA 
TION OF THE OLDER MEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE UNINITIATED THE 
RESERVE OF THE INITIATED THE HURRY AND PREOCCUPATION OF EV 
ERYONE AND THE INNUMERABLE COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS 
OF WHOSE EXISTENCE HE LEARNED EVERY DAY HE FELT THAT NOW IN 
 HERE IN PETERSBURG A VAST CIVIL CONFLICT WAS IN PREPA 
RATION THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF WHICH WAS A MYSTERIOUS 
PERSON HE DID NOT KNOW BUT WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN 
OF GENIUSSPERANSKI AND THIS MOVEMENT OF RECONSTRUCTION 
OF WHICH PRINCE ANDREW HAD A VAGUE IDEA AND SPERANSKI 
ITS CHIEF PROMOTER BEGAN TO INTEREST HIM SO KEENLY THAT THE 
QUESTION OF THE ARMY REGULATIONS QUICKLY RECEDED TO A SEC 
ONDARY PLACE IN HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
PRINCE ANDREW WAS MOST FAVORABLY PLACED TO SECURE GOOD 
RECEPTION IN THE HIGHEST AND MOST DIVERSE PETERSBURG CIR 
CLES OF THE DAY THE REFORMING PARTY CORDIALLY WELCOMED 
AND COURTED HIM THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE HE WAS REPUTED TO WAR AND PEACE BE CLEVER AND VERY WELL READ AND SECONDLY BECAUSE BY LIB 
ERATING HIS SERFS HE HAD OBTAINED THE REPUTATION OF BEING A 
LIBERAL THE PARTY OF THE OLD AND DISSATISFIED WHO CENSURED 
THE INNOVATIONS TURNED TO HIM EXPECTING HIS SYMPATHY IN 
THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF THE REFORMS SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WAS THE 
SON OF HIS FATHER THE FEMININE SOCIETY WORLD WELCOMED HIM 
GLADLY BECAUSE HE WAS RICH DISTINGUISHED A GOOD MATCH 
AND ALMOST A NEWCOMER WITH A HALO OF ROMANCE ON ACCOUNT 
OF HIS SUPPOSED DEATH AND THE TRAGIC LOSS OF HIS WIFE BE 
SIDES THIS THE GENERAL OPINION OF ALL WHO HAD KNOWN HIM 
PREVIOUSLY WAS THAT HE HAD GREATLY IMPROVED DURING THESE 
LAST FIVE YEARS HAVING SOFTENED AND GROWN MORE MANLY LOST 
HIS FORMER AFFECTATION PRIDE AND CONTEMPTUOUS IRONY AND 
ACQUIRED THE SERENITY THAT COMES WITH YEARS PEOPLE TALK 
ED ABOUT HIM WERE INTERESTED IN HIM AND WANTED TO MEET

PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO EXTENUATE HIS ACTION SO AS NOT TO 
IRRITATE THE OLD MAN USELESSLY
AFRAID OF BEING LATE SAID THE OLD MAN LOOKING AT 
KOCHUBEY

WHETHER IT WAS FROM RESPECT ENVY OR ANTICIPATION HE DID 
NOT KNOW SPERANSKIS WHOLE FIGURE WAS OF A PECULIAR TYPE 
THAT MADE HIM EASILY RECOGNIZABLE IN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH 
PRINCE ANDREW LIVED HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE WHO TO 
GETHER WITH AWKWARD AND CLUMSY GESTURES POSSESSED SUCH 
CALMNESS AND SELFASSURANCE HE HAD NEVER SEEN SO RESOLUTE 
YET GENTLE AN EXPRESSION AS THAT IN THOSE HALFCLOSED RATHER 
HUMID EYES OR SO FIRM A SMILE THAT EXPRESSED NOTHING NOR

AS PEOPLE INVOLUNTARILY DO ON ENTERING A LARGE COMPANY AND 
WAS IN NO HURRY TO SPEAK HE SPOKE SLOWLY WITH ASSURANCE 
THAT HE WOULD BE LISTENED TO AND HE LOOKED ONLY AT THE PER 
SON WITH WHOM HE WAS CONVERSING
PRINCE ANDREW FOLLOWED SPERANSKIS EVERY WORD AND 
MOVEMENT WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION AS HAPPENS TO SOME 
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY TO MEN WHO JUDGE THOSE NEAR TO THEM SE 
VERELY HE ALWAYS ON MEETING ANYONE NEWESPECIALLY ANYONE 
WHOM LIKE SPERANSKI HE KNEW BY REPUTATIONEXPECTED TO 
DISCOVER IN HIM THE PERFECTION OF HUMAN QUALITIES
SPERANSKI TOLD KOCHUBEY HE WAS SORRY HE HAD BEEN UN  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMABLE TO COME SOONER AS HE HAD BEEN DETAINED AT THE PALACE HE 
DID NOT SAY THAT THE EMPEROR HAD KEPT HIM AND PRINCE AN 
DREW NOTICED THIS AFFECTATION OF MODESTY WHEN KOCHUBEY 
INTRODUCED PRINCE ANDREW SPERANSKI SLOWLY TURNED HIS 
EYES TO BOLKONSKI WITH HIS CUSTOMARY SMILE AND LOOKED AT 
HIM IN SILENCE
I AM VERY GLAD TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE I HAD HEARD 
OF YOU AS EVERYONE HAS HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE
KOCHUBEY SAID A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE RECEPTION ARAKCHEEV 
HAD GIVEN BOLKONSKI SPERANSKI SMILED MORE MARKEDLY
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON ARMY REGULATIONS 
IS MY GOOD FRIEND MONSIEUR MAGNITSKI HE SAID FULLY AR 
TICULATING EVERY WORD AND SYLLABLE AND IF YOU LIKE I CAN PUT 
YOU IN TOUCH WITH HIM HE PAUSED AT THE FULL STOP I HOPE 
YOU WILL FIND HIM SYMPATHETIC AND READY TO COOPERATE IN 
PROMOTING ALL THAT IS REASONABLE
A CIRCLE SOON FORMED ROUND SPERANSKI AND THE OLD MAN 
WHO HAD TALKED ABOUT HIS SUBORDINATE PRYANICHNIKOV AD 
DRESSED A QUESTION TO HIM
PRINCE ANDREW WITHOUT JOINING IN THE CONVERSATION 
WATCHED EVERY MOVEMENT OF SPERANSKIS THIS MAN NOT LONG 
SINCE AN INSIGNIFICANT DIVINITY STUDENT WHO NOW BOLKONSKI 
THOUGHT HELD IN HIS HANDSTHOSE PLUMP WHITE HANDSTHE FATE 
OF RUSSIA PRINCE ANDREW WAS STRUCK BY THE EXTRAORDINARILY 
DISDAINFUL COMPOSURE WITH WHICH SPERANSKI ANSWERED THE 
OLD MAN HE APPEARED TO ADDRESS CONDESCENDING WORDS TO 
HIM FROM AN IMMEASURABLE HEIGHT WHEN THE OLD MAN BE 
GAN TO SPEAK TOO LOUD SPERANSKI SMILED AND SAID HE COULD 
NOT JUDGE OF THE ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE OF WHAT PLEASED WAR AND PEACE THE SOVEREIGN
HAVING TALKED FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN THE GENERAL CIRCLE SPER 
ANSKI ROSE AND COMING UP TO PRINCE ANDREW TOOK HIM ALONG 
TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE THOUGHT IT 
NECESSARY TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN BOLKONSKI
I HAD NO CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU PRINCE DURING THE 
ANIMATED CONVERSATION IN WHICH THAT VENERABLE GENTLEMAN 
INVOLVED ME HE SAID WITH A MILDLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE 
AS IF INTIMATING BY THAT SMILE THAT HE AND PRINCE ANDREW 
UNDERSTOOD THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE 
HAD JUST BEEN TALKING THIS FLATTERED PRINCE ANDREW I HAVE 
KNOWN OF YOU FOR A LONG TIME FIRST FROM YOUR ACTION WITH 
REGARD TO YOUR SERFS A FIRST EXAMPLE OF WHICH IT IS VERY DE 
SIRABLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE IMITATORS AND SECONDLY 
BECAUSE YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN OF THE CHAMBER WHO 
HAVE NOT CONSIDERED THEMSELVES OFFENDED BY THE NEW DECREE 
CONCERNING THE RANKS ALLOTTED TO COURTIERS WHICH IS CAUSING 
SO MUCH GOSSIP AND TITTLETATTLE
NO SAID PRINCE ANDREW MY FATHER DID NOT WISH ME TO 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVILEGE I BEGAN THE SERVICE FROM THE 
LOWER GRADE
YOUR FATHER A MAN OF THE LAST CENTURY EVIDENTLY STANDS 
ABOVE OUR CONTEMPORARIES WHO SO CONDEMN THIS MEASURE 
WHICH MERELY REESTABLISHES NATURAL JUSTICE
I THINK HOWEVER THAT THESE CONDEMNATIONS HAVE SOME 
GROUND RETURNED PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO RESIST SPERAN 
SKIS INFLUENCE OF WHICH HE BEGAN TO BE CONSCIOUS HE DID 
NOT LIKE TO AGREE WITH HIM IN EVERYTHING AND FELT A WISH TO 
CONTRADICT THOUGH HE USUALLY SPOKE EASILY AND WELL HE FELT  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMA DIFFICULTY IN EXPRESSING HIMSELF NOW WHILE TALKING WITH 
SPERANSKI HE WAS TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN OBSERVING THE FA 
MOUS MANS PERSONALITY
GROUNDS OF PERSONAL AMBITION MAYBE SPERANSKI PUT IN 
QUIETLY
AND OF STATE INTEREST TO SOME EXTENT SAID PRINCE AN 
DREW
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED SPERANSKI QUIETLY LOWERING 
HIS EYES
I AM AN ADMIRER OF MONTESQUIEU REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW 
AND HIS IDEA THAT LE PRINCIPE DES MONARCHIES EST LHONNEUR 
ME PARAIT INCONTESTABLE CERTAINS DROITS ET PRIVILEGES DE LA 
NOBLESSE ME PARAISSENT ETRE DES MOYENS DE SOUTENIR CE SEN 
TIMENT
THE PRINCIPLE OF MONARCHIES IS HONOR SEEMS TO ME IN 
CONTESTABLE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES FOR THE ARISTOCRACY 
APPEAR TO ME A MEANS OF MAINTAINING THAT SENTIMENT
THE SMILE VANISHED FROM SPERANSKIS WHITE FACE WHICH 
WAS MUCH IMPROVED BY THE CHANGE PROBABLY PRINCE AN 
DREWS THOUGHT INTERESTED HIM
SI VOUS ENVISAGEZ LA QUESTION SOUS CE POINT DE VUE HE 
BEGAN PRONOUNCING FRENCH WITH EVIDENT DIFFICULTY AND 
SPEAKING EVEN SLOWER THAN IN RUSSIAN BUT QUITE CALMLY
IF YOU REGARD THE QUESTION FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW
SPERANSKI WENT ON TO SAY THAT HONOR LHONEUR CANNOT 
BE UPHELD BY PRIVILEGES HARMFUL TO THE SERVICE THAT HON 
OR LHONNEUR IS EITHER A NEGATIVE CONCEPT OF NOT DOING WHAT 
IS BLAMEWORTHY OR IT IS A SOURCE OF EMULATION IN PURSUIT OF 
COMMENDATION AND REWARDS WHICH RECOGNIZE IT HIS ARGU WAR AND PEACE MENTS WERE CONCISE SIMPLE AND CLEAR
AN INSTITUTION UPHOLDING HONOR THE SOURCE OF EMULA 
TION IS ONE SIMILAR TO THE LEGION DHONNEUR OF THE GREAT 
EMPEROR NAPOLEON NOT HARMFUL BUT HELPFUL TO THE SUCCESS 
OF THE SERVICE BUT NOT A CLASS OR COURT PRIVILEGE
I DO NOT DISPUTE THAT BUT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT COURT 
PRIVILEGES HAVE ATTAINED THE SAME END RETURNED PRINCE AN 
DREW EVERY COURTIER CONSIDERS HIMSELF BOUND TO MAINTAIN 
HIS POSITION WORTHILY
YET YOU DO NOT CARE TO AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE PRIVILEGE 
PRINCE SAID SPERANSKI INDICATING BY A SMILE THAT HE WISHED 
TO FINISH AMIABLY AN ARGUMENT WHICH WAS EMBARRASSING 
FOR HIS COMPANION IF YOU WILL DO ME THE HONOR OF CALLING 
ON ME ON WEDNESDAY HE ADDED I WILL AFTER TALKING WITH 
MAGNITSKI LET YOU KNOW WHAT MAY INTEREST YOU AND SHALL 
ALSO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF A MORE DETAILED CHAT WITH YOU
CLOSING HIS EYES HE BOWED A LA FRANCAISE WITHOUT TAKING 
LEAVE AND TRYING TO ATTRACT AS LITTLE ATTENTION AS POSSIBLE HE 
LEFT THE ROOM FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMCHAPTER VI
DURING THE FIRST WEEKS OF HIS STAY IN PETERSBURG PRINCE 
ANDREW FELT THE WHOLE TREND OF THOUGHT HE HAD FORMED DUR 
ING HIS LIFE OF SECLUSION QUITE OVERSHADOWED BY THE TRIFLING 
CARES THAT ENGROSSED HIM IN THAT CITY
ON RETURNING HOME IN THE EVENING HE WOULD JOT DOWN IN 
HIS NOTEBOOK FOUR OR FIVE NECESSARY CALLS OR APPOINTMENTS 
FOR CERTAIN HOURS THE MECHANISM OF LIFE THE ARRANGEMENT OF 
THE DAY SO AS TO BE IN TIME EVERYWHERE ABSORBED THE GREATER 
PART OF HIS VITAL ENERGY HE DID NOTHING DID NOT EVEN THINK 
OR FIND TIME TO THINK BUT ONLY TALKED AND TALKED SUCCESS 
FULLY OF WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT WHILE IN THE COUNTRY
HE SOMETIMES NOTICED WITH DISSATISFACTION THAT HE RE 
PEATED THE SAME REMARK ON THE SAME DAY IN DIFFERENT CIRCLES 
BUT HE WAS SO BUSY FOR WHOLE DAYS TOGETHER THAT HE HAD NO 
TIME TO NOTICE THAT HE WAS THINKING OF NOTHING
AS HE HAD DONE ON THEIR FIRST MEETING AT KOCHUBEYS 
SPERANSKI PRODUCED A STRONG IMPRESSION ON PRINCE ANDREW 
ON THE WEDNESDAY WHEN HE RECEIVED HIM TETEATATE AT HIS 
OWN HOUSE AND TALKED TO HIM LONG AND CONFIDENTIALLY
TO BOLKONSKI SO MANY PEOPLE APPEARED CONTEMPTIBLE AND 
INSIGNIFICANT CREATURES AND HE SO LONGED TO FIND IN SOMEONE 
THE LIVING IDEAL OF THAT PERFECTION TOWARD WHICH HE STROVE 
THAT HE READILY BELIEVED THAT IN SPERANSKI HE HAD FOUND THIS 
IDEAL OF A PERFECTLY RATIONAL AND VIRTUOUS MAN HAD SPER WAR AND PEACE ANSKI SPRUNG FROM THE SAME CLASS AS HIMSELF AND POSSESSED 
THE SAME BREEDING AND TRADITIONS BOLKONSKI WOULD SOON 
HAVE DISCOVERED HIS WEAK HUMAN UNHEROIC SIDES BUT AS IT 
WAS SPERANSKIS STRANGE AND LOGICAL TURN OF MIND INSPIRED 
HIM WITH RESPECT ALL THE MORE BECAUSE HE DID NOT QUITE 
UNDERSTAND HIM MOREOVER SPERANSKI EITHER BECAUSE HE 
APPRECIATED THE OTHERS CAPACITY OR BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED 
IT NECESSARY TO WIN HIM TO HIS SIDE SHOWED OFF HIS DISPAS 
SIONATE CALM REASONABLENESS BEFORE PRINCE ANDREW AND 
FLATTERED HIM WITH THAT SUBTLE FLATTERY WHICH GOES HAND IN 
HAND WITH SELFASSURANCE AND CONSISTS IN A TACIT ASSUMPTION 
THAT ONES COMPANION IS THE ONLY MAN BESIDES ONESELF CA 
PABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THE FOLLY OF THE REST OF MANKIND AND 
THE REASONABLENESS AND PROFUNDITY OF ONES OWN IDEAS
DURING THEIR LONG CONVERSATION ON WEDNESDAY EVENING 
SPERANSKI MORE THAN ONCE REMARKED WE REGARD EVERYTHING 
THAT IS ABOVE THE COMMON LEVEL OF ROOTED CUSTOM OR WITH 
A SMILE BUT WE WANT THE WOLVES TO BE FED AND THE SHEEP TO 
BE SAFE OR THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS AND ALL IN A 
WAY THAT SEEMED TO SAY WE YOU AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT 
THEY ARE AND WHO WE ARE
THIS FIRST LONG CONVERSATION WITH SPERANSKI ONLY 
STRENGTHENED IN PRINCE ANDREW THE FEELING HE HAD EXPERI 
ENCED TOWARD HIM AT THEIR FIRST MEETING HE SAW IN HIM A 
REMARKABLE CLEARTHINKING MAN OF VAST INTELLECT WHO BY HIS 
ENERGY AND PERSISTENCE HAD ATTAINED POWER WHICH HE WAS 
USING SOLELY FOR THE WELFARE OF RUSSIA IN PRINCE ANDREWS 
EYES SPERANSKI WAS THE MAN HE WOULD HIMSELF HAVE WISHED 
TO BEONE WHO EXPLAINED ALL THE FACTS OF LIFE REASONABLY CON  FREE EBOOKS AT PLANET EBOO KCOMSIDERED IMPORTANT ONLY WHAT WAS RATIONAL AND WAS CAPABLE 
OF APPLYING THE STANDARD OF REASON TO EVERYTHING EVERY 
THING SEEMED SO SIMPLE AND CLEAR IN SPERANSKIS EXPOSITION 
THAT PRINCE ANDREW INVOLUNTARILY AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT 
EVERYTHING IF HE REPLIED AND ARGUED IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE 
HE WISHED TO MAINTAIN HIS INDEPENDENCE AND NOT SUBMIT TO 
SPERANSKIS OPINIONS ENTIRELY EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT AND EV 
ERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE ONLY ONE THING DISCONCERTED 
PRINCE ANDREW THIS WAS SPERANSKIS COLD MIRRORLIKE LOOK 
WHICH DID NOT ALLOW ONE TO PENETRATE TO HIS SOUL AND HIS 
DELICATE WHITE HANDS WHICH PRINCE ANDREW INVOLUNTARILY 
WATCHED AS ONE DOES WATCH THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO POSSESS 
POWER THIS MIRRORLIKE GAZE AND THOSE DELICATE HANDS IRRITAT 
ED PRINCE ANDREW HE KNEW NOT WHY HE WAS UNPLEASANTLY 
STRUCK TOO BY THE EXCESSIVE CONTEMPT FOR OTHERS THAT HE 
OBSERVED IN SPERANSKI AND BY THE DIVERSITY OF LINES OF ARGU 
MENT HE USED TO SUPPORT HIS OPINIONS HE MADE USE OF EVERY 
KIND OF MENTAL DEVICE EXCEPT ANALOGY AND PASSED TOO BOLD 
LY IT SEEMED TO PRINCE ANDREW FROM ONE TO ANOTHER NOW 
HE WOULD TAKE UP THE POSITION OF A PRACTICAL MAN AND CON 
DEMN DREAMERS NOW THAT OF A SATIRIST AND LAUGH IRONICALLY 
AT HIS OPPONENTS NOW GROW SEVERELY LOGICAL OR SUDDENLY RISE 
TO THE REALM OF METAPHYSICS THIS LAST RESOURCE WAS ONE HE 
VERY FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED HE WOULD TRANSFER A QUESTION TO 
METAPHYSICAL HEIGHTS PASS ON TO DEFINITIONS OF SPACE TIME 
AND THOUGHT AND HAVING DEDUCED THE REFUTATION HE NEEDED 
WOULD AGAIN DESCEND TO THE LEVEL OF THE ORIGINAL DISCUSSION
IN GENERAL THE TRAIT OF SPERANSKIS MENTALITY WHICH STRUCK 
PRINCE ANDREW MOST WAS HIS ABSOLUTE AND UNSHAKABLE BELIEF
